They add a nice, mild and tender element to everything from salads, to pastas, to pizzas, and everything in between. Did you know, though, that if you take a whole artichoke heart and remove all the small, soft leaves from the top, you’re left with a naturally bowl-shaped Artichoke Bottom? And furthermore, did you know that Trader Joe’s Artichoke Bottoms have the same delicately nutty flavor and buttery mouthfeel as a fresh artichoke heart, can be used in all the same culinary contexts as artichoke hearts, and also make fun, flavorful, edible vessels for seafood, salads, and more? Well, now you do!

        "description": " A filled donut is truly one of life’s most delightful little indulgences—something about the combination of a crisp, golden brown, perfectly fried exterior, a light, airy, and delicate interior, and a lush, sweet, full-flavored filling makes you feel like you’re in the lap of luxury, even if just for a moment. That’s certainly how we felt when we tried Trader Joe’s Portuguese Donuts for the first time. Made for us by a supplier in Portugal, these tasty takes on a bola de Berlim (the Portuguese name for what the Germans call a Berliner) are hand-fried, hand-split, and hand-filled with a captivatingly creamy and remarkably rich Chocolate Hazelnut Filling, then finished with a sprinkle of sugar, so that every bite is a superlatively sumptuous eating experience.

        "description": " Plantains are far more than just semi-savory bananas—in many cuisines around the world, they’re as common a carb as rice, potatoes, or wheat. And of the myriad plantain preparations that these cuisines have produced, one of our absolute favorites is known across Central America and the Caribbean by several names: you may have heard of it referred to as maduros, tajadas, or amarillos. Made by slowly pan-frying sliced, ripened plantains until caramelized to a golden brown, our love for this toothsomely-textured, lightly sweet side dish inspired us to bring in our own version, simply called Trader Joe’s Sweet Ripe Plantains.

It’s just robust enough to serve as the base of a tofu and veggie soup or seafood stew. It adds verve to noodles, rice or lentils when used in place of water for cooking.

Trader Joe’s Chicken Shu Mai builds on this tradition with a slight tweak—we’ve replaced the traditional pork with Chicken, complemented by carrots, garlic, green onions, and ginger. The filling is neatly wrapped in a wheat-flour dumpling with the top left unsealed, creating a sort of dumpling “cup.” Together, the tender wrapper and savory filling meet their collective flavor destiny with a dip in the tangy, soy-based sauce we’ve included in the package.

        "description": " Combining the saltiness and sweetness of teriyaki, the umami notes of miso, the meatiness of mushrooms, and the delighftul fluffiness of a bao bun, Trader Joe’s Teriyaki Mushroom Mini Bao Buns may be mini, but every bite is mighty flavorful. Our supplier in Vietnam starts with a mix of sliced oyster, king oyster, and shiitake mushrooms, along with chopped carrots, onions, and spring onions for a nice variety of flavors and textures, then sautées them all in a rich and aromatic teriyaki miso sauce. After that, they stuff it into Mini rolls of dense and slightly sweet Bao Bun dough, which, when steamed or microwaved at home, takes on a light and fluffy consistency that consummately complements the sweet and savory veggies within.

        "description": " On its own, caramel is a superlatively capable confection. It’s rich, buttery, and remarkably sweet—a massive presence on the palate. When combined with some complementary element, however, it becomes something else entirely: a foundation on which to build captivatingly complex structures of flavor. Nowhere is that more evident than in Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Covered Caramels. They’re made for us by an expert supplier, who starts with a super sweet and enchantingly chewy square of lightly salted, vanilla-tinged Caramel, then coats it in a layer of full-flavored, tooth-sinkable Dark Chocolate. Together, this toothsome twosome of ingredients play off one another beautifully: the bitter elements of the Chocolate bring out the vanilla in the Caramel, while the delicately salty and sweet notes of the Caramel heighten the Chocolate’s muted fruity flavors.

        "description": " Ever wonder why some olives are green and some are black? It’s all about how they’re cured: when picked right off the tree, olives are actually quite inedible. They naturally contain a few phenolic compounds that are extremely bitter to the human palate, but which can be removed by curing them in an alkali solution. In the early 20th century, a speedy curing process was developed using a combination of curing solutions, compressed air, and heat treatments to oxidize these compounds out, which results in a softer texture, milder flavor, and deep black hue. Olives cured the old-fashioned way, like Trader Joe’s Medium Green Ripe Pitted Olives, take much longer to cure, but retain their original green color, are relatively firmer in texture, and comparatively richer with buttery, briny flavor.

        "description": " Food historians trace the origins of the kishu mandarin (or kishu mikan, as it’s known in Japan) all the way back to Southern China in the 8th century CE. Sometime in the 1200s, it made its way to the Kii (also known as Kishū) province of Southern Japan, where it was celebrated for its small size, sweet flavor, and remarkably easy-to-separate sections. While the kishu first arrived in the United States in the 19th century, it wasn’t until a seedless variety was developed in the 1980’s that it became commercially available, and only in recent years has it gained a significant stateside fandom. We’re certainly fans, which is why we’re so appreciative of the more-than- a-millenium-long journey it took for these one-pound bags of Kishu Kisses Mandarins to arrive in our stores.

While it combines influences from both South Asian and Southeast Asian cooking (already two of the tastiest cuisines on the global stage), it’s undeniably a world-class culinary tradition all its own. Just take a look at the flavors, aromas, and textures to be found within Trader Joe’s Organic Sri Lankan Curry & Seasoned Rice with Cashews, for example. Made for us by an esteemed supplier in Sri Lanka, this all-in-one Curry kit contains a packet of stupendously savory, heirloom variety, wild Sri Lankan Rice and a packet of captivatingly creamy coconut Curry sauce, both of which are generously seasoned with spices like cinnamon, curry leaves, cumin seeds, and coriander. To top it all off, you’ll also find a packet of rich, roasted Cashews to provide a bit of protein, along with some complementary crunch.

And if you haven’t, you’re in for a tasty, texturally tantalizing treat: imagine a classic, corn tortilla taco packed with savory fillings, neatly folded in half, then fried to a glorious golden (hence “dorado”) brown. Each bite starts with a resounding crunch from the crispy exterior, then continues on to the soft, super flavorful fillings inside. Drawing inspiration from this unbeatable eating experience, Trader Joe’s Crispy Potato & Poblano Pepper Tacos are made for us by an expert supplier in Mexico, who fills each Taco with a mix of seasoned mashed Potatoes and ever-so- slightly spicy Poblano Peppers.

        "description": " Like many traditional foods, bresaola originated out of pure necessity. Way back in the medieval era, fresh meat was scarce during Northern Italy’s frigid winters, so locals would prepare by salting, seasoning, and dry-aging beef to preserve it—much in the same way one would with fresh pork for prosciutto. During the dry-aging process, the beef would lose most of its moisture, reducing its total weight by nearly half and concentrating its rich, meaty flavor significantly. While preservation techniques have certainly evolved, global appreciation for bresaola’s bold and beefy flavor has only grown over the centuries, which is precisely why we’ve brought in Trader Joe’s Sliced Bresaola to our refrigerator cases.

Typically, most hummus starts with a base of just four primary ingredients: chickpeas, tahini, garlic, and lemon juice. From there, you’re free to use it as your canvas—we’ve certainly done so, incorporating other flavors like Roasted Red Pepper, Olive Tapenade, and Crunchy Chili Onion. But even aside from adding flavors, just adjusting the proportions of one of the existing base ingredients yields remarkable results. Take Trader Joe’s Dreamy Creamy Hummus, for instance. Here, our supplier doubles the amount of tahini of a standard hummus recipe to create a texture so thick, rich, and exquisitely Creamy that it’s simply Dreamy.

However, instead of allowing the Monterey Jack to fully mature and turn into the well-loved, semi-soft cheese that it is, peppers are added during the cheesemaking process. This is where the “Pepper” part of the name comes in. Jalapeño peppers, habanero peppers, and red bell peppers are diced and added into the cheese resulting in perfectly spicy and incredibly herbaceous cheese.

        "description": " As if one needed yet another reason to love butter, we invite you to consider the transformative power that Trader Joe’s Butter with Parmesan, Garlic & Herb brings to the table. It’s made for us in small batches by a creamery with an uncommon knack for compound butters, who mixes in a hefty portion of Parmesan cheese along with dried garlic and parsley into smooth, salted butter. (What do we mean by hefty? Our supplier mixes in so much Parmesan that each four-ounce roll is roughly 25% cheese, by weight!) It all results in a splendidly savory and oh-so-spreadable butter that’s ready to bring some rich, full flavor to all sorts of culinary contexts.

        "description": " When we first introduced Trader Joe’s Peppermint Pretzel Slims to our shelves (nearly ten years ago), it truly changed the way we thought about peppermint. Before then, peppermint existed in our imaginations as strictly within the realm of sweets. After one superbly sweet-salty-crunchy-cool bite of these thin and crispy Pretzel Slims in a white chocolatey coating with crushed Peppermint candy, however, our entire perception of peppermint, and the world of sweet-savory snacks in general, changed for the better. It makes an excellent addition to any holiday dessert table.

Made for us by an expert confectioner in France, this gleefully anarchic assemblage features soft, chewy, satisfyingly sweet gummies in Festive shapes (like ornaments, trees, holly, and a jolly snowman), along with classic Gummy forms like gummy bears and cola bottles, and a few “why-the-heck-not” shapes like mustaches and tennis shoes—all in a variety of vibrant, vivid hues. All together, it creates one delightfully kaleidoscopic clash of Candies that’s like an edible ode to yuletide disarray.

Undeterred, she worked through some tasty trial and error (a hard job, we know) with our expert candy partner to craft these truly magical Marshmallows. Striking the ideal balance of fluffy and chewy in a more manageable, two-bite size, the Marshmallows are Dipped into Dark Chocolate to form a rich and toothsome outer shell—and just before that sets, they’re covered in a flurry of crushed Candy Cane bits.

We included more Root vegetables, of course – taro, a sweet, pale colored root native to Asia, and batata, basically a white sweet potato, and last but most definitely not least, parsnips, a root vegetable closely related to carrots, but faint in color. The Vegetables are picked and reconstructed into the form of tasty Chips. They are crunchy, crispy, and naturally pretty sweet too. We are seriously “rooting” for these chips!

However, one in every ten to twenty packs just enough capsaicin to provide a fun little pop of heat. There’s no easy way to tell a mild shishito from a hot one, so enjoying them as an appetizer becomes something of a game of chance. It turns out that those same elements of savoriness and surprise are also present when you vacuum-fry them until they’re a satisfyingly crunchy snack—which is precisely what Trader Joe’s Shishito Crisps are.

        "description": " As the legend goes, an 18th century cardinal from Milan went to visit the town of Saronno in the Lombardy region of northern Italy. A couple who owned a small bakery there wanted to celebrate his visit with a special pastry, but all they had were apricot kernels, sugar, and egg whites. This lack proved serendipitous, since what they created with their scant ingredients came to be known as the now beloved amaretti cookies. The details of this cookie’s exact origins may be debatable, but what we do know for certain is that Trader Joe’s Crunchy Italian Amaretti Cookies are coming to your neighborhood store this holiday season!

They’re made especially for us by a suppler who smothers each set of hearty, savory Short Ribs in a rich, umami-tinged Balsamic Glaze, seals them in a vacuum-tight bag, then cooks them at low temperatures for twelve whole hours, until they’re tantalizingly tender. With all that taken care of for you, all that’s needed on your end is to heat them in the oven or stovetop — and to pick out a suitably delicious side to serve them with, of course.

It’s still crafted exclusively from the whole milk of the region’s Manchega sheep according to strict, traditional methods. From the six months careful aging to the basket-weave pattern on the cheese’s rind, to the aromas of flowers, nuts, and lavender, Trader Joe's Manchego is traditional in all ways but one: price. Generally, the price for this very special cheese tends to be very high. But because we sell a great deal of Manchego, we’ve been able to negotiate a terrific cost from our supplier, which in turn enables us to offer it to you for an excellent price. Try it shaved over a salad, as part of a charcuterie board with Truffle Salami, or really break the mold and melt slices over a burger to create a buzz of international proportions.

It begins its life as a pasteurized whole milk cheese that originates in Gloucestershire County, England. It’s a golden yellow, semi-hard cheese that is similar to cheddar, but not quite as hard. The “double” variety is aged longer than “Single Gloucester” which lends to a firmer cheese with a stronger, more savory flavor.

        "description": " It’s not exactly going out on a limb to say that any particular veggie will be particularly delicious when coated in batter and fried until crisp. But when we tell that you that the earthy, deeply savory flavors of shiitake mushrooms happen to be spectacularly suited to a coating of crispy-fried batter, believe us. Because we’ve tried Trader Joe’s Crispy Shiitake Mushrooms, and they are above and beyond the delights of your everyday onion ring or zucchini fry. It’s all owed to our supplier in Vietnam, who oversees the mushroom growing process to ensure that they’re all the ideal size for frying, then preps them all in small batches so that every bite is balanced between the batter’s crispiness and the Shiitakes’ meaty texture and umami-forward flavor.

        "description": " The mangosteen may just be one of the most fascinating fruits you’ll ever encounter. Native to southeast Asia, where it’s been cultivated for thousands of years, a ripe mangosteen has the outward appearance of something like a round, purple persimmon. When peeled open, however, it becomes apparent that the purple exterior is really an inedible exocarp, and that the actual fruit inside is soft, white, and sectioned like the inside of a tangerine. Upon eating one, you’ll discover that its sweet and faintly tart flavor profile is like a mix between a stone fruit, a citrus, and a strawberry. We’ve found that it’s a profile that’s pitch perfect for capturing in the form of a freeze dried fruit snack, so that’s exactly what we’ve done with Trader Joe’s Freeze Dried Mangosteen.

As if bacon really needed to be more appealing… yet this really does make it more appealing!

        "description": " Ah, for the multitude of sweet, smoky, and savory flavors contained within a single serving of elote. Arguably one of the more successful street foods in all of global cuisine, elotes as we most commonly know them today (grilled corn with butter or mayonnaise, cheese, lime juice, and chile powder) originated in Mexico, with roots to pre-Columbian indigenous cuisine—the world “elote” comes from the Nahuatl “elotitutl,” for “tender cob,” in fact. Drawing inspiration from this utterly iconic antojito, Trader Joe’s Nuts About Elote Mix is made with crispy, puffed corn kernels and roasted cashews, dusted a cheesy, peppery, elote-evoking seasoning blend, along with pepitas and pretzel sticks to provide some complementary crunch.

        "description": " Would it be hyperbolic to describe pizza as \"universally beloved?\" Perhaps, but it's hard to deny pizza's overwhelming popularity, and when you break down the average slice of pizza to its constituent parts, it's easy to see why: rich, tangy tomato sauce, super savory cheeses, satisfylingly crisp crust, and herby, aromatic seasonings...it's a set of flavors that deserves to be celebrated in other culinary contexts, too. Which is exactly why added Trader Joe's Pizza Ranch Salad Kit to our refrigerators. Made with a base of fresh, shredded Romaine lettuce, red cabbage, and carrots, along with a set of pizza-evoking toppings like herby flatbread strips, four-cheese crisp crumbles, and grated Parmesan, each Kit also contains a superlatively creamy Ranch dressing flavored with seasonings like dried garlic, onion, and tomato powder to tie everything together.

We like it on burgers and Korean Style Short Ribs, or brushed on chicken before grilling. It’s a natural for dipping things like gyoza, egg rolls or spring rolls. You may also try grilling peaches or nectarines and dipping them in Sweet Chili Sauce.

        "description": " Ah, for the multitude of sweet, smoky, and savory flavors contained within a single serving of elote. Arguably one of the more successful street foods in all of global cuisine, elotes as we most commonly know them today (grilled corn with butter or mayonnaise, cheese, lime juice, and chile powder) originated in Mexico, with roots to pre-Columbian indigenous cuisine—the world “elote” comes from the Nahuatl “elotitutl,” for “tender cob,” in fact. Drawing inspiration from this utterly iconic antojito, Trader Joe’s Nuts About Elote Mix is made with crispy, puffed corn kernels and roasted cashews, dusted a cheesy, peppery, elote-evoking seasoning blend, along with pepitas and pretzel sticks to provide some complementary crunch.

Rather, its title comes from the fact that its rich aromas and umami undertones evoke an ineffable, subtly seafood-y quality that’s celebrated in Szechuan cuisine.

It’s also a flavor that we think should be available to everyone—even those that don’t consume alcohol. That’s why, in addition to our seasonal Double Fold Vanilla Extract, we offer Trader Joe’s Double Fold Alcohol Free Bourbon Vanilla Flavoring during the fall and winter seasons. Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans (which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid), our supplier makes each batch with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Flavoring that provides an impressive pop of vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.

Botanically, it’s more closely related to summer squashes like zucchini; its skin isn’t as tough as it first appears, and when you cook it, the skin becomes barely detectable. Because of this softer skin, Delicata doesn’t store as well, or for as long, as other winter squash varieties, mak- ing it an autumn treasure that’s worth seeking out during its short tenure.

Fast-forward to present day, and you, dear customers, can enjoy the crisp, firm texture and crunchy bite of SugarBees®. Their flavor hints at caramel and molasses, with distinct notes of honey—a fitting homage to their raison d’etre (reason for bee-ing, if you will).

Produced for us in Leicestershire, in the heart of the Vale of Belvoir, to be precise, this White Stilton¨ is made only from locally pasteurized cow’s milk, infused with a sweet Apple & Pear compote and dried red Apple pieces. It’s unpressed during its six-week aging period, which is the key to creating its characteristically airy texture. The result is a sensationally light, slightly tangy cheese that offers pops of fruitiness throughout, complementing the savory flavor and creamy-crumbly nature of the base. Consider crumbling this Stilton¨ atop a salad, or layering a thick slice on a grilled vegetable sandwich. Of course, it presents particularly well on a cheeseboard alongside Pumpkin Cranberry Crisps and freshly sliced pears (plan ahead—it’s best enjoyed after a 30-minute rest at room temperature).

A parade of spices—cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, ginger, and cloves, to be exact— intermingle with notes of vanilla to create the classic spice profile one would expect to find in autumnally- inspired baked goods. Topping it off is a crowning layer of crunchy sugar and a generous dusting of aromatic, fall-forward spices, ensuring every bite is is imbued with the spirit of the season.

As we approach the autumn months, and temperatures begin to lower, it’s the perfect time for hearty chilis, capsaicin-loaded curries, super-spicy soups, and red-hot roasted veggies and proteins of all kinds. In support of this autumnal argument, we submit Trader Joe’s Sweet Potato Habanero Hot Sauce. Made for us by a famed hot sauce supplier out of Atlanta, Georgia, each batch is made from a base of vinegar, sweet potatoes, and habanero peppers, as well as a mix of autumnally-appropriate spices like cinnamon, ginger, allspice, and cloves.

When fresh, the fruit is large and heart-shaped with firm flesh, reddish-purple coloring, and a tart taste. Their size may shrink to the size of a marble after 48-60 hours of drying, but their color and flavor? They’re amplified to their most sour, deep garnet-red form with newly crisp texture.

Mini pretzels!), it yields Everything one would want in a great cookie—and all that’s required from your end is a stick of butter, an egg, and some elbow grease. After a quick stint in the oven, you’ll be rewarded with a true textural triumph of a cookie: crispy outer edges surrounding a delightfully chewy center, interspersed with melty chocolate and caramelized sugar bits throughout.

Inspired by the dancing bears at German festivals, he molded his invention into a bear shape that gained worldwide popularity over the decades that followed. Fast forward to today, and Trader Joe’s Milk Chocolate Covered Gummy Bears evoke charming, chocolatey nostalgia in every bite!

They start with a base of ground turkey, crushed tomatoes, and red beans, then season it all with diced green chile peppers and jalapeños, onions, and a suite of classic chili seasonings including garlic powder, cumin, and oregano. It all results in a superlatively hearty and satisfying home-style Chili that’s equally excellent as an entrée or topping.

        "description": " It would be difficult to overstate just how delicious a plate of mango sticky rice can be. From that refreshing initial bite of the buttery sliced mango, to the soft, chewy texture of the coconut milk-saturated rice, to the way those contrasting flavors and textures play off of one another on the palate, it’s an unquestionably top-tier dessert. The question that Trader Joe’s Mango Sticky Rice Crisps asks is “can a top-tier dessert also become a top-tier snack?” We’re confident that every satisfyingly sweet and crunchy bite of these Crisps will answer that question with a resounding, “Of course! It’s Mango Sticky Rice!

Here, among the sloping, seaside hills, family-owned farms have cultivated olives for generations stretching back to the furthest edges of antiquity. Available at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s for a limited time, Eliros Extra Virgin Olive Oil comes to us from a collective of these small, family farms, who hand-pick Koroneiki olives and cold extract them (which is to say, spin them in a centrifuge until the oil seperates from the fruit, all while keeping everything below 80°F). The cold extraction process further preserves the olives’ rich flavor, resulting in a lush, buttery, and delightfully tangy EVOO that’s especially suited for drizzling over grilled fish, finishing off a well-seared steak, and dipping with a nice hunk of bread.

        "description": " While most folks would probably peg the hamburger as the most representative American food, we'd have to  throw our support behind the humble hot dog. Aside from its close association with baseball (the American national pastime) and summertime (arguably the most American season, though that's another topic altogether), only pizza comes close to the hot dog in its proliferation of regional variation throughout these United States. Practically every major American state and city has their own specific spin on hot dogs, from the vibrantly vegetal Chicago dog, to the chili-and-onion-smothered dogs of Coney Island, to the bacon-wrapped hot dogs of Los Angeles. And so, to help celebrate the holistically American hot dog, we proudly offer Trader Joe's Uncured Beef Hot Dogs, to be enjoyed in whatever preparation you prefer-from sea to shining sea.

In fact, it’s inspired us to celebrate the season the best way we know how: with jammy shortbread cookies. Trader Joe’s Lemon Flower Cookies are made for us by a trusted bakery partner, who starts with a base of beautifully buttery shortbread dough that’s been flavored with lemon oil and colored a pastel yellow with turmeric. After shaping the dough into a fancifully floral shape and baking it to a flawlessly crumbly texture, they then fill the center with a lemon jam, so that every bite sings with a satisfyingly citric sweetness.

        "description": " From the moment they were introduced, our Steamed Chicken Soup Dumplings and Steamed Pork & Ginger Soup Dumplings became instant sensations among our customers. Inspired by the winsome dim sum tradition of Chinese xiao long bao, these aromatic and savory, soup-filled dumplings are such a darling, in fact, that we’ve received countless requests to make a vegan version, as well. After trying a few variations, our tasting panel found that a mix of jackfruit, carrot, cabbage, spinach, and ginger for the filling, along with a hearty, aromatic broth (made with vegan-friendly agar-agar, rather than gelatin) made for a truly captivating combination—and thus, Trader Joe’s Steamed Vegetable Soup Dumplings were born!

In terms of flavor, there’s the earthy, delicately sweet notes of a finely roasted pistachio, which plays remarkably well off of the rich, ever-so-slightly bitter elements of dark chocolate. And texture-wise, the tooth-sinking smoothness of dark chocolate superbly rounds out a pistachio’s tender interior after its initial, delicately snappy bite. It’s like they were made for each other—a match made in snacking heaven, if you will. We certainly will, which is precisely why we’ve introduced Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Covered Pistachios to our shelves.

        "description": " An indisputable icon of Thai restaurant menus and street food stalls the world over, pad see ew translates to “fried with soy sauce,” and was likely popularized within Thailand by Chinese immigrants in the early 20th century. A bit like a localized, Thai-cuisine-informed variation of chow fun (which was likely a direct inspiration), pad see ew is traditionally made with wide, flat rice noodles, which are fried in a wok with various veggies and garlic before being finished with a splash of light and dark soy sauce to give it a bold, savory, and umami-rich flavor. And that’s the same, time-tested technique that our supplier in Thailand uses when making Trader Joe’s Pad See Ew, a rich, flavorful, and totally vegan version of this classic dish that’s now available in our freezers.

Look no further than Trader Joe’s Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack!

Each and every bite is crunchy, spicy, bursting with savory flavor, and, somehow, better than the last.

Each and every bite is crunchy, spicy, bursting with savory flavor, and, somehow, better than the last.

Made with a captivating combination of chili peppers, sea salt, and peel of yuzu (a citrus that’s downright essential in Japanese cuisine), Trader Joe’s Yuzu Kosho offers thrilling heat, invigorating zestiness, and even a touch of umami in every bracing bite.

Since its debut back in 2017, it has remained perennially popular, and it’s easy to see why: it turns out that garlic, onion, poppy, sesame, and sea salt synergize with a whole lot more than just bagels. Take, for instance, this new addition to our cheese section, Trader Joe’s Everything But the Bagel Cheddar Cheese. It’s crafted just for us by an expert cheesemaker, who infuses each wheel with the very same seasoning we sell on our shelves, so that each bite is rich with the maximalist mix of aromatic alliums, crunchy seeds, and savory spice you know and love.

Even beyond the “super-fruit” status of strawberries, this Sorbet has other superb qualities going for it. Our supplier in Thailand starts with locally harvested strawberries that have a balanced, sweet & tart flavor, which translates sensationally when blended with water & cane sugar to form the smooth Sorbet base.

These Meatless Meatballs are expertly crafted from textured soy protein (TSP)—which is what remains after extracting the oil from soybeans. It’s “textured” because it has the appearance & mouthfeel of meat. It’s “protein” because it naturally contains a notable amount of protein—13g of protein per 4-Meatball serving.

But when you put them together, as the talented hands behind Mobay® Cheese have done, that’s something else entirely. Crafted for us by the certified Master Cheesemakers at a renowned Wisconsin creamery, our latest Spotlight Cheese is made by stacking together wheels of flavorful goat’s milk cheese and sheep’s milk cheese, with just a thin layer of faintly smoky grapevine ash between them.

        "description": " Shrimp, garlic, butter, lemon, and white wine. The ingredients to a classic shrimp scampi feel so made for one another, so iconic in their expression of flavor when combined, that it’s somewhat shocking to realize that the dish is only about a century old. In fact, when it was invented in Italy during the 1920s, it was simply known as “scampi,” and featured langoustine lobster, rather than shrimp. As delicious as that certainly was, we’re glad to be living in the era of the modern shrimp scampi we all know and love—an era which now includes the consummately convenient and phenomenally flavorful Trader Joe’s Shrimp Scampi, available in our freezers.

Whereas maki is typically made with vinegar-seasoned rice and focuses on one filling (like a single variety of vegetable or fish), kimbap is made with sesame oil-seasoned rice, and can contain all kinds of combinations of savory fillings. Trader Joe's Kimbap, for example, takes a veggie-forward approach. Our supplier, a kimbap expert in the Republic of Korea, arranges an assortment of sautéed greens, crunchy root vegetables, and crisp pickles around a base of braised tofu, wraps it all in a layer of rice and seaweed, then slices it into two-or-three-bite-sized rounds.

Because for a limited time, we’re bringing in this super limited-edition Early Harvest Extra Virgin Olive Oil from the folks at Red Island® in Australia, and at a price that’s a fraction of what you’d pay for similar, early- harvest olive oil elsewhere.

In the case of Trader Joe’s Freeze Dried Raspberries, for example, it’s done by freezing ripe raspberries, then lowering the atmospheric pressure around them to near-vacuum levels. After this, they’re heated, which causes a curious reaction where the frozen water within the berries instantly transitions to a vapor, skipping the liquid phase entirely. And since raspberries are mostly water, what remains of each raspberry is super concentrated with their signature, sweet-tart flavor–in fact, it takes more than a half a pound of fresh raspberries to make each 1.2-ounce pouch of our Freeze Dried Raspberries.

        "description": " Honeycomb candy—or “sponge candy,” “seafoam candy,” or “cinder candy,” depending on what part of the world you’re in—is a classic confection composed of sugar, honey, and baking soda . Nowadays, most versions found at specialty candy shops or online (when you can find them, that is) aren’t actually made with honey—but they are accompanied by a formidable price tag. So you can imagine our delight when our product developer presented what is now Trader Joe’s Milk Chocolate Covered Honeycomb Candy to the tasting panel!

Just like a wine’s terroir, the environment in which olives are grown makes a tremendous difference in how their oil will ultimately taste. And, just as it is with a fine wine, smaller batches and more dedicated, hands-on production methods tend to result in significantly higher quality. That’s certainly the case with this highly limited offering from the folks at Cal Pressed. Made with olives sourced from a handful of small, family farms in California’s Central Valley, this first pressing of their 2023 harvest is beautifully balanced, with a lush, butter-forward profile that’s accented by gentle fruity and peppery notes, before finishing with just a subtle hint of grass.

Our Taiwanese supplier knows well the ways of Boba, which originated in their country circa the 1980s. You can think of this candy version as a deconstructed bubble beverage, where the center of each piece is precisely that pearl (aka tapioca ball) that usually lives at the bottom of your Boba cup. Each individual, caramelized- brown-sugar flavored pearl is surrounded by a creamy coating, then given a classic Japanese rice-wrapper treatment.

While the first recorded recipes for couscous date back to the 11th century CE, some archaeological evidence suggests that ancient cultures in the region may have enjoyed couscous (or foods very similar to it) as far back as the third century BCE. So, how should we honor a dish with such a superlatively storied history? We’re starting by introducing Trader Joe’s Organic Couscous to our grocery shelves. Now, all that separates you from this marvelously mild-flavored and delicately-textured side dish is a cup of water or broth, a microwave or stove, and a few minutes of your time.

Still, it’s enough extra fat to give Whole Milk Yogurt a creamier texture—a trait that classic Greek yogurt really showcases.

More specifically, it’s our take on takikomi gohan, a traditional Japanese style of rice flavored with soy sauce and mirin (a tangy rice wine). Our version contains shelled edamame, pieces of deep fried tofu, and thin strips of hijiki seaweed. What’s inside the package is fully cooked—you can heat it in minutes in a microwave or skillet or wok—and works brilliantly as either a side with a larger Japanese-inspired meal or as the main dish for a vegetarian feast. You could also go the fusion route and serve it topped with Sriracha and a fried egg. You’ll find it alongside the other fried rice options in our freezers.

Of course, a dish with such a delightfully complex \neating experience usually results from an equally complex cooking experience, and one doesn't always have the \ntime to fire-roast, stuff, batter, and fry a whole pepper. That's what makes Trader Joe's Chiles Rellenos Con \nQueso so convenient-now, having a hearty chile relleno at home is simply a matter of letting it cook in the \nmicrowave, air fryer, or conventional oven, heating the included zesty tomato sauce on the stove or microwave, \ncombining, and enjoying.

Look no further than Trader Joe’s Spicy Tempura Seaweed Snack!

Each and every bite is crunchy, spicy, bursting with savory flavor, and, somehow, better than the last.

They’re shorter and flatter than California almonds, with a distinctive flavor and a light, crunchy texture. We’ve taken that flavor profile a step up by adding whole dried rosemary to the mix. The nuts are roasted in expeller pressed sunflower oil, dusted with sea salt and sprinkled with whole rosemary. They’re a real treat. You can use them in recipes (just the thought of Green Beans Rosemary Marcona Amandine makes us smile), present them as an hors d’oeuvre or eat them right out of the bag. They’re excellent with a glass of crisp white wine – perhaps a Sauvignon Blanc or Côtes du Rhône. We’ve found them to be quite difficult to resist; you may want to err on the side of caution and have several bags on hand in case of emergencies. And napkins. You’ll need napkins.

        "description": " Cod is one veritably versatile fish. Firm, yet remarkably flaky in texture, with a mild, delicately sweet flavor profile, it’s equally delicious whether its baked, blackened, steamed, or sautéed. In other words, it’s precisely the kind of fish you want to have on hand during the spring, when fish fries and seafood boils are just beginning to warm up. That’s why, for the season, we’re carrying Trader Joe’s Cod Fillets, a delicious, all- purpose, wild-caught whitefish option that’s excellent in everything from tangy fish tacos, to creamy seafood chowders, to classic fish and chips.

Nutritious, versatile, and remarkably easy to work with, salmon typically only needs a bit of seasoning before it’s ready to be cooked. Over the years, we’ve received many requests from our customers for pre-seasoned salmon, to make it even easier to go from the fridge to the dinner table. That’s precisely why we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Blackened Salmon to our fresh meat and seafood section.

Take it from us: once you make a sandwich with cauliflower, you'll find yourself wondering if cauliflower's wonders ever cease, too. Perfectly sized for a number of uses - including as a vehicle for avocado toast, a tortilla or pita, or even as a kind of savory, cheesy pancake, if you're so inclined - these Cauliflower Slims provide all the structure and texture of flatbread with a fraction of the carbs (only three grams of carbs per serving of two Slims, to be precise!). And since each Slim is made with Parmesan and nutritional yeast baked right in, every bite is filled with a nice, savory cheesy flavor that complements deli meats, condiments, and sauces wonderfully.

        "description": " Black Peppercorns are the dried, unripe fruit of Piper nigrum, one of the world’s most significant spice plants. The bite of pepper is part of what makes it so prized, and this unique pungency comes from a naturally occurring chemical in the skin called piperine. When exposed to the elements (air, heat, water), piperine can break down. Our Black Peppercorns come whole and packaged in their own Grinder, which is a benefit to maintaining freshness, along with a culinary convenience. Remove the cap, turn the jar upside down and twist to get pure, piquant flecks of black pepper. Or you can screw off the cap if you need to add some whole peppercorns to your pot. To add depth and vibrancy to flavors, grind our Black Peppercorns over eggs, steak, mashed potatoes, pasta, soup, sprouts, freshly sliced tomatoes, strawberries...you get the picture.

With Trader Joe’s Pizza Party Potato Chips, we may have just encapsulated that feeling into a crispy, crunchy, satisfyingly bite—or, we should probably say, three bites. That’s because each bag of our limited-edition Pizza Party Potato Chips contains a mix of three classic, kettle-style chips in three distinct flavors: rich and aromatic Cheese & Garlic, hearty and lightly spicy (and vegetarian, by the way) Pepperoni, and tangy, delicately sweet Pizza Sauce. When eaten together, this trio of flavors coalesces into a singular eating sensation that enthusiastically evokes the essence of a slice of pepperoni pizza. In other words, each bag is a portable Pizza Party, just waiting to happen!

        "description": " Satay may be the one of most celebrated street foods in the history of global cuisine. Originating in Malaysia possibly as far back as the 1400s, love for satay has spread across Southeast Asia in the ensuing centuries, including the Philippines, Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia, where it has since been enshrined as a national dish. Now a favorite among foodies the world over, the popularity of satay skewers has brought with it a commensurate appreciation for satay sauce (also known as sambal kacang.) As our very own Trader Joe’s Thai Peanut Satay Sauce demonstrates, this sweet, savory, and lightly spicy peanut-based sauce makes the ideal accompaniment to a classic chicken satay skewer—and so much more, too.

This philosophy of continuous, incremental improvement, popularized in mid-20th century Japan, doesn’t just apply to the way we work, it also applies to the food we sell. For example, when our Egg Salad took a brief hiatus from our refrigerators, we took the opportunity to see how we could make it even more delicious. Now returning to our refrigerators with a new look and a new recipe, Trader Joe’s Egg Salad might just be one the tastiest examples of kaizen in action you’ll ever encounter.

We commissioned a century-old, family-owned bakery in France to make these deceptively simple, classic French cookies. These pastry professionals begin by layering puff pastry with butter and sugar. The pastry is then rolled in such a way so that when the roll is cut, each slice resembles a charming heart. As the heart-shaped cookies bake, the heat of the oven caramelizes the butter and sugar, while the dough develops an impossibly crisp and flaky texture. But we didn’t stop there! Post-baking, the cookies are glazed with even more caramel. Hearts be still!

        "description": " \"Just add beer and butter\"-possibly the five best words to be combined in one sentence. It's also the phrase you'll find gracing each box of Trader Joe's Beer Bread Mix. Preparation is simple enough: Stir 12 ounces of the beer of your choosing into the Mix, and add the dough to a greased loaf pan. Pour some melted butter over the top, pop it into the oven, and your work is done! No matter what kind of beer you use (a lager for a lighter loaf, an IPA for a hearty, hoppy taste, or a stout for a rich result with a slightly darker finished product), you'll end up with malty, buttery bread with a golden crust and tender crumb. And while we're fans of baking, we're also fans of enjoying fresh bread after a long day at work-this Mix provides that fresh-baked, belly-warming goodness, without the spend-all-weekend-making-it level of effort that usually accompanies such bread baking projects. Aside from its malty, buttery dreamy-ness and incredible convenience, the beauty of Trader Joe's Beer Bread Mix is you can customize it to your liking. Experiment with different beers, or to the dough. Serve the finished loaf with a bowl of your favorite chili or soup for supper-without a doubt, it's the craveable comfort food required in the face of blustery winter weather.

It’s also the inspiration behind the newest addition to our grocery shelves: Trader Joe’s Aglio Olio Garlicky & Spicy Seasoning Blend.

        "description": " Believe it or not, Trader Joe’s Chocolate Almond Biscotti have been delighting customers in some form or fashion for more than 30 years. And while the white paper packaging and minimalist label might be somewhat unassuming, the Biscotti inside is anything but. Our supplier starts with a classic biscotti base made with all the usual suspects, like flour, eggs, sugar, and baking soda, then adds plenty of almonds. They bake the Biscotti twice, then dip their undersides in semisweet chocolate, ensuring you get plenty of rich Chocolate and nutty Almond flavor in every bite. They’re excellent standalone treats, and they make elegant dipping accompaniments to a cup of coffee or tea. A crushed-up biscotto even makes for a smashing addition to a cup of yogurt or a scoop of ice cream.

        "description": " If you’ve ever spent any time baking, you’ve likely dealt with vanilla extract before (it’s basically the duct tape of the baking world). What you might not have encountered, however, is vanilla paste. What’s the difference, you ask? Aside from their distinct methods of production (vanilla extract is made by soaking pure vanilla beans in a solution of water and alcohol, whereas vanilla paste is a mix of vanilla beans, sugar syrup, and some vanilla extract to tie them all together), vanilla paste is thicker, richer in taste, and tends to have more visible bits of vanilla bean throughout, making it a preferable option for recipes where you really want the vanilla to be front and center. And that’s exactly where Trader Joe’s Bourbon Vanilla Bean Paste excels.

We’ve heard people singing their praises with phrases like “best cracker ever” and “oh-so-much- more than just a cracker,” and “I simply cannot stop eating these crackers!” They really do taste just like little pita breads, only really crunchy. Excellent with cheeses, dips, and spreads, they also make creative carriers for lunch options like chicken, tuna, or egg salad.

        "description": " When you’re longing for the ease of a bake-and-serve pizza with the flair of French cuisine, look no further than Trader Joe’s Tarte aux Champignons. This French-style flatbread has been a favorite in our freezers since 2006, boasting an umami-rich, cozy construction that makes it an especially apt choice to combat the winter’s chill. It starts with a thin, crisp crust with hand-braided edges, topped with crème fraîche and a velvety Emmental cheese sauce. Next, white mushrooms and oyster mushrooms are added in abundance—and it’s their intense, woody, earthy flavors that elevate this flatbread to its deserved level of distinction. Finally, a dusting of Parmesan Reggiano adds a pleasant sharpness to complement the luxuriously creamy sauce and funky fungi.

Unlike our Mochi snacks, made from glutinous rice, the rice grains in these Crackers don’t break down into an entirely smooth paste. This difference contributes to the Cracker’s unique, craggy texture. These affectionately named Crunchies then get tossed in a Sweet & Salty glaze, made from soy sauce and sugar, that delivers some serious Umami in every bite (To those wheat intolerant folks who sighed at the words soy sauce, great news—the soy sauce in this snack is gluten free, made with rice, instead of wheat.

Where our bakers diverge is in the inclusion of flax seeds, rather than sesame seeds. We find that this variation on the everything theme results in an even more savory, even more satisfyingly crunchy topping, which, combined with our bakery partner’s expertise in baking an impeccably soft and chewy Bagel at its base, resoundingly results in a better Bagel all around. And we love everything about that.\n \nTrader Joe’s Almost Everything Bagels make an excellent carb for a traditional breakfast or brunch of eggs and your favorite protein, as well as an awesome solo morning treat, either eaten on the go or enjoyed with your favorite traditional bagel toppers. Speaking of which, we’d be utterly remiss if we didn’t mention how well they pair with our also-Everything-ified Everything But the Bagel Smoked Salmon. With a little smoked salmon, a generous layer of Whipped Cream Cheese, some tomato, red onion, and fresh Dill, we assure you: nothing beats our Almost Everything Bagels.

        "description": " A true building block of many East Asian cuisines, the origins of rice vinegar date somewhere between four and five thousand years ago to ancient China. It’s traditionally made by fermenting rice wine, and over its long and storied history has been used as everything from a flavoring agent, to a preservative, to beverage in its own right. It comes in a variety of colors ranging from red, to white, to brown and black, and is sometimes seasoned with sugar or other flavorings. Trader Joe’s Rice Vinegar is styled after an everyday, unseasoned, white rice vinegar, but it’s certainly not lacking for flavor. Tart, tangy, and just a touch sweet, with a slightly sharp note for cutting through and brightening other flavors, it’s an ideal ingredient for adding to salad dressings, sauces, and marinades of all kinds.\n \nA bit of our Rice Vinegar will add an extra dimension of flavor to stir-fries, soups, and even just a freshly cooked pot of plain white rice. When mixed with soy sauce, it makes an excellent condiment for any of our gyoza or soup dumpling options, though we’ll leave the exact ratio to your personal tastes (some prefer equal parts soy sauce to Rice Vinegar, others enjoy two parts Vinegar to one part soy sauce). And when making quick pickles or a last-minute seaweed salad, our Rice Vinegar is nothing short of a must-have.

        "description": " Trader Joe's Plain Bagels are really good bagels, made for us using quality ingredients and without the use of artificial preservatives or dough conditioners. The secret to their bagel excellency is their baking process. First, the dough is proofed in high humidity and then set out to slowly ferment, which brings out all of the dough’s delicious, subtle flavors. Next, the bagels are kettle-boiled—fully submerged in boiling water to lock in that chewy center and create that perfect “skin.” Finally, they’re off to the hearth tunnel oven to be baked until they’ve acquired that perfect, golden-brown bagel crust.

        "description": " In the 18th century, baking was a slightly more involved process than it is today. Back then, French bakers relied on ovens that took quite a long time to heat up, and even longer to cool down. So, after they were done making their breads for the day à grand fours (“at large oven,” i.e., at full heat), they would take the opportunity to use their oven’s residual heat to bake small, delicate pastries à petit fours (“at small oven,” i.e., at diminishing heat). Though ovens have changed over the years, the fandom for petit fours cakes has only grown. We’re certainly fans, which is precisely why we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Petit Fours Mousse Cakes to our bakery tables for the holidays.

        "description": " Like so many of the world’s tastiest creations, the first tarte Tatin came about quite by accident. As the story goes, in setting out to make a traditional apple pie, an overworked French hotelier (a one Ms. Stéphanie Tatin, co-owner of the Hôtel Tatin) left her apples cooking in butter and sugar for far too long. To salvage her extra- caramelized endeavor, she placed a layer of pastry over the apples, popped the whole pan in the oven, and served the resulting dessert upside-down. Her guests loved this accidental apple pie-alternative so much that it became a fixture on the menu and, ultimately, rose to prominence all over France.

        "description": " Trader Joe’s Cranberry Butter Cookies are made for us in France, and their simplicity belies a sophisticated culinary pedigree. The dough starts with wheat flour, sugar, and cultured butter, to which eggs, leavening, and a touch of salt are added to create the classically crumbly, shortbread cookie base. A hint of cinnamon is included for a subtly fragrant, but not overwhelmingly spiced flavor, and sweetened dried cranberries bring a touch of chewy texture and tartness to the party. That’s it!

        "description": " With all the big, bold, creamy, tangy, savory, and sweet cheeses in our stores at this time of year, crackers go from optional accompaniment to absolute necessity. While we always have a vast array of crackers from which to choose, during the winter months, we also offer an astutely assembled cracker assortment by the name of Trader Joe’s Scalloped Cracker Trio, to cover all your entertaining needs. \n    \nFlavored in three distinct styles—savory garlic, aromatic rosemary, and delicately spicy chili—each Cracker has an artfully scalloped edge which makes them present particularly well when fanned out around a cheese plate. Texturally, each Cracker is not so delicate as to collapse under the weight of a slice of Figgy Cheddar, nor are they so hearty or heavy as to overpower the flavor of our Creamy Gorgonzola—an ideal balance of structure and crispness, we like to think.

And while our Josie’s Mandarins may not be as rare as their predecessors, they’re just as capable of delivering sweetness and sunshine with every bite. Smaller than the standard navel variety, these seedless, handheld orbs possess an easy-to-peel rind and candy-sweet citrus flavor that make them an ideal snack or lunchbox addition for kids and kids-at-heart (and unlike candy, they won’t melt in your purse or pocket). Their juice and zest add delightful complexity to an olive oil cake (visit traderjoes.com for the recipe!). Additionally, their vivid orange hue adds an air of tropical glamour to a centerpiece or gift basket— or, in a nod to history, a stocking!

        "description": " Some of the first recipes for gingerbread originated in Ancient Greece, over 2,000 years ago. These early versions were a little closer to honey-sweetened flatbreads than the pastry we know today, and they hardly had the architectural utility we currently enjoy in our Gingerbread House Kits, but the point remains: for millennia, people have known that good things happen when you bake ginger into your bread. A few years ago, we reached out to a baker who not only knows ginger, but is also expert at baked goods made without the use of any animal-derived products. They created a loaf to our specifications, and we promptly made the decision to bring it into our stores. And thus, Trader Joe’s Vegan Gingerbread Loaf was born.

Combining the satisfyingly chewy crumb structure of an Italian focaccia with the signature flair of French baking, fougasses where often just as practical as they were palatable, way back when: prior to the widespread use of thermometers, some bakers would use the time it took to fully cook a fougasse to determine how hot an oven was. Now, we can’t speak to the temperature measuring abilities of Trader Joe’s Olive Fougasse, but we can tell you that its crisp, delicious crust, light, airy interior, and generously distributed slices of Kalamata and black olives make for one seriously delicious, anytime bread.

        "description": " The mighty Pecan takes its name from a Native American word of Algonquin origin, and while the jury is still out on its preferred pronunciation (pah-KAHN, PEE-can, PEE-kahn—you pick), we think most would agree that its noblest use is in the making of a classic dessert: Pecan Pie. \n    \nTrader Joe’s Pecan Pie is an indulgent nod to Southern culinary tradition. Its buttery, brown-sugary base is decidedly sweet, just as a pecan pie should be; its soft, melt-in-your-mouth texture is the ideal counterpoint to the generous amounts of crunchy pecans added to each batch. The Pie is baked just until set, creating a crispy outer crust and a gooey, caramelized center. Serve it warm with a scoop of ice cream for dessert, or alongside a freshly brewed cup of coffee for breakfast. Because who says you can’t have pie for breakfast? Certainly not us.

They’re loaded with dried, sweetened cranberries, which make up 20% of the recipe. They also contain pistachios (about 10% of the recipe). This combination of cookie, fruit, and nuts presents a burst of complementary flavors—crunchy, chewy, sweet, tart, nutty. The crowning glory is a generous drizzle of confectionery icing. Eat them plain—or better yet, dunk them in your hot coffee for a melt-in-your-mouth-cookie experience!

There are also a few winsome woodland creatures made of sugar (an owl, a deer, a squirrel, and a fox, to be exact) that you can place around the property to give your Gingerbread House an even homier feeling.

The ornaments are berry flavored, the trees are sour apple flavored, and the stars are star-flavored. Just kidding—just wanted to be sure you were actually reading. (The stars taste like sparkling grape.) We’ve used dyes made from spirulina, as well as fruit & vegetable extracts, to give the shapes their festive colors.

Tender sheets of egg pasta are layered with creamy ricotta, tangy tomato sauce, and plenty of ground beef and pork seasoned with onion and garlic (the words “ultimate comfort food” would not be hyperbole here). Topped with an additional trifecta of cheeses—mozzarella, Romano, and Parmesan—the Lasagna is made fresh, then frozen and shipped to our stores, ready to report for “What’s for dinner?” duty. It reheats in about an hour in the oven, leaving you plenty of time to kick back with a glass of dry Chianti, and throw together a crunchy green salad with tangy vinaigrette to serve as a refreshing counterpoint to the Lasagna’s lusciously cheesy, marvelously meaty profile.

The dough is paired with a tart Raspberry filling that’s been sweetened with a bit of sugar and complemented with a touch of lemon juice to further amplify the fruit. But rather than rolling them into the classic Croissant shape, the layers of dough are sandwiched around the jammy filling, like a coffee cake—a sedimentary construction that allows for the inclusion of much more filling than you’d find in an individual croissant.

        "description": " Among Spain’s many contributions to the culinary world, Spanish cheeses and Spanish olives may be among their best. Our latest Spotlight Cheese, Gran Capitan Oliva Negra, is a savory salute to these two Spanish specialties. Made by the same supplier as previous Spotlight entry Gran Capitan Reserva, Gran Capitan Oliva Negra follows its predecessors’ suit in being made with a mix of multiple kinds of milk, this time combining cow, sheep, and goat for a complex range of creaminess, nuttiness, and tartness. Where it truly sets itself apart, however, is in the introduction of rich veins of briny black olive paste, which brings on a whole other level of umami-forward flavors to every bite.

        "description": " Ropa vieja is a much-adored entrée, globally, with variations in a multitude of cultures across the Americas, the Iberian Peninsula, and the Philippines. It’s particularly treasured within the culinary canon of Cuba, where it is celebrated as the country’s national dish. So named for its resemblance to old, torn-up clothing, the Cuban version of ropa vieja is typically made with shredded beef stewed in a rich, tomato-based sauce, along with onions, bell peppers and a savory suite of satisfyingly zesty spices. That’s the approach our supplier in Florida— the capital of Cuban cuisine within the U.S., we might add—takes with Trader Joe’s Empanadas de Ropa Vieja, which recontextualizes this classic dish into the cozy confines of a crisp, cassava-based pastry crust.

However you use them, you’ll be delighted to learn that we offer Organic Cranberries during the holiday season. Starting in spring, our Organic Cranberries are grown on trailing vines in cranberry bogs (that’s grower-speak for marshes & wetlands). They’re cultivated in colder regions, including Wisconsin and Quebec, where sandy soil allows roots to go deep, even though the cold weather inevitably comes early. While this makes for a shorter growing season, it naturally permits fewer insects—eliminating the need for insecticides. And though the crops are smaller, the cranberries are more robust... and organic!

Of course, the velvety mouthfeel and naturally sweet, squashy flavor have the power to underpin cinnamon, ginger, citrus, nutmeg, and clove in the perfect Pumpkin Pie (aka The Official Dessert of ThanksgivingTJ). And this purée of organically grown Cucurbitaceae has enjoyed increasing prominence outside the provenance of pie over the years, as the boast-worthy base of savory seasonal favorites like pumpkin soup and pumpkin gnocchi.

        "description": " Named after the Italian word for “butterflies”, and also known in other parts of Italy as strichetti (“bow ties”), Farfalle are far and away one of our very favorite pasta shapes. While their resemblance to pollinators and pieces of neckwear is certainly charming, they also serve a purpose beyond simple aesthetics: both the ruffled edges of the “wings” and the pinched point in the middle help each piece of Farfalle hold on to sauces and oils, and thus deliver more flavor with every bite. Made for us by the same expert Italian pasta manufacturer as many of our celebrated, limited-run, organic pastas, Trader Joe’s Organic Farfalle Rigate takes this design philosophy one step further, via the introduction of radiating ridges (hence, “Rigate”) on every piece.

        "description": " What’s the difference between a pancake and a griddle cake? In certain parts of the world, the two are more or less synonymous. But when and where they do differ, it’s largely a matter of height: while a typical pancake tends to be rather thin, griddle cakes are usually considerably thicker, with a springier, slightly chewier texture that’s comparable to a Crumpet. That certainly fits the bill for our frozen, fully-cooked, and ready- to-heat Trader Joe’s Dutch Griddle Cakes. They’re made for us by a supplier in the Netherlands, who crafts each Cake to a luxuriously lofty stature, creating an altogether elevated breakfast option.

        "description": " Not so very long ago, in 1982, a man in Verona, Italy invented ciabatta bread. He decided the loaf looked quite like his wife’s slippers (the English translation of ciabatta), and so bread named after footwear was born. Even more recently, we decided to start selling such bread, like Trader Joe’s Ciabatta Rolls (even though these are more like miniature slippers).

        "description": " Where does one even begin to recommend occasions for Trader Joe’s Roasted Hatch Chile & Jalapeño Cheese Dip? Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and sensationally spicy appetizer Dip, and goes from there. Even with that in mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of sour cream, cream cheese, and Cheddar, and flavored with fiery, roasted Hatch chiles and jalapeños, it heats up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the microwave (or a smidge longer in your conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your favorite fresh veggies.

And while it’s easy enough to cook up a chicken breast when you need it, you really can’t beat the convenience of our Premium Chicken Breast in Water. You can keep it in your pantry until you need it for whatever comes to mind. Make a quick Chicken salad with the ingredients of your choice – we like a bit of mayo mixed with some curry powder, chopped celery and a handful of raisins or dried cherries. Combine the Premium Chicken with some chicken broth, black beans, canned corn, Homestyle Salsa Especial, Shredded Mexican Cheese Blend, and tortilla chips for a super quick and delightfully delicious chicken tortilla soup. Add it to a green salad for an easy protein boost.

While technically not a nut in a strictly scientific sense (botanically, it’s actually considered a drupe, in the same family as plums and cherries), it’s undoubtedly earned its multitude of spaces upon the shelves of our nut section. Our newest almond-powered addition to said section, Trader Joe’s Garlic & Black Pepper Almonds, deftly demonstrates why: by adding just a simple suite of savory seasonings (black pepper, sea salt, and dehydrated garlic and onion), these crunchy, well-roasted Almonds take on a whole new dimension of flavor, offering alluring, allium aromatics and a subtle, yet satisfying, level of spice.

        "description": " When we set out to create one of our all-in-one salad kits, sometimes it comes down to simply testing out a theory. For example: just on a conceptual level alone, the mild, lightly grassy flavor and remarkably creamy texture of avocado should make it a natural companion to the savory, herby sensations of a classic ranch dressing. We put that theory into practice with Trader Joe’s Avocado Ranch Salad Kit, by compiling a collection of fresh, crisp, shredded leafy greens and veggies, savory, grated Cheddar, and crunchy, lightly salted corn chips to act as a canvas for a captivaingly creamy ranch dressing made with a base of buttermilk and avocados. As it turns out, that theory was delightfully, deliciously correct. Don’t you just love the scientific method?

        "description": " According to historians, trick-or-treating traces its origins to a 16th-century custom in Scotland and Ireland known as “guising.” Back then, children (and a few adults) would don costumes and go to door-to-door asking for fruit, baked goods, or money in exchange for reciting poetry (an aspect we are, arguably, spared from in the modern era). While it wasn’t until the early 20th century that the practice and the phrase “trick or treat” were popularized in North America, it’s clear that the desire to give and get candy on a chilly autumn night has been with us for a long, long time. Which is precisely why we’re proud to finally get in on the game with Trader Joe’s Wicked Good Mini Chocolate Bars!

Cocoa powder is added to this Croissant dough to give it a subtle chocolate flavor and deep brown hue. It also impacts the texture—giving the baked Croissant a softer interior than our non-cocoa enhanced croissants. After the lamination process, two sticks (yes, two!) of rich, semi-sweet Chocolate are placed in the center of the dough before it is rolled into the classic pain au chocolat shape. Each box comes with four Croissants, so you can make as few or as many as you’d like. Remove them from the package and let them proof overnight (just as a bakery would); in the morning you’ll find the Croissants have nearly tripled in size! Bake them in the oven for 25 minutes (your kitchen will smell marvelous) for Croissants with delicately crisp exteriors and melted Chocolate within. Yummmmm.

Perhaps one starts from the premise that any occasion can be vastly improved by the addition of a superlatively creamy, remarkably cheesy, and deeply, aromatically garlicky appetizer Dip, and goes from there. Even with that in mind, we must say that this particular Dip surpasses all expectation. Made with a base of sour cream, cream cheese, mozzarella, and Asiago, it heats up to a magnificently molten texture after just a few minutes in the microwave (or a smidge longer in your conventional oven), at which point it scoops spectacularly well with tortilla chips, baguette slices, or your favorite fresh veggies.

Sure, there have been contenders for the crown over the years, but with all respect to the soups and salads of the world, nothing quite complements a sandwich as well as the briny, herby flavor and juicy, satisfying crunch that only pickles can provide. And Trader Joe’s Kosher Dill Pickle Spears, available now in our refrigerators, are particularly proficient at providing both of those crucial elements. Much of that is owed to the fact that our supplier cold-packs them in a savory, well-seasoned brine, which helps them maintain their delectably crisp structure more than their hot-packed, shelf stable cousins. All that results in a fresher feel, fuller flavor, and even more resounding crunch at lunch.

All in all, this cereal is a sweet combination of those three nuts and four grains - oats, rice, corn, and wheat. Every bite boasts a wide variety of crunchy textures and toasty flavors, plus a lively note of rich toffee, turning any rote, mundane breakfast into something a little more special. \n \nEnjoy Trader Joe’s Super Nutty Oat Clusters in the classic way, poured into a bowl with milk or non-dairy alternative (such as a dairy free beverage like our Non-Dairy Oat Beverage for even more variety). Enjoy it mixed with your other favorite nuts or dried fruit for a quick trek mix to stow on the go. And for a texturally tantalizing sweet treat, simply sprinkle it over your favorite yogurt with a spoonful of your favorite fruit preserves for an effortless parfait.

Taking their name from the Italian tagliatare, meaning “to cut,” the long, ribbon-like noodles are wider and slightly thinner than fettuccine. They’re dried into nests that easily unravel in a pot of boiling water; when cooked al dente, they possess a pleasant chew akin to durum wheat pasta, ready to support the heartiest sauces with ease. Try making your own Cacio e Pepe by adding Grated Pecorino Romano Cheese and freshly cracked Black Peppercorns to a some of the reserved pasta water before tossing it with the Tagliatelle Pasta.

In reality, vanilla is a rapturously rich and utterly unique flavor. Sweet, warm, and enchantingly floral, there’s a reason that vanilla is such a ubiquitous inclusion in baked goods and sweet treats—it’s simply very good at making desserts, and even savory dishes, taste better. That’s why, starting now through the end of the holiday season, we’re proud to offer Trader Joe’s Double Fold Vanilla Extract. Using Madagascar-grown vanilla beans (which, like all natural vanilla, are actually the seed pods of a tropical orchid ), our supplier makes each batch with twice the amount of vanilla as a standard strength extract (hence, Double Fold.) They then further fortify it with Vanilla Bean Seeds, resulting in a pleasantly potent Vanilla Extract that provides an impressive pop of vanilla flavor to cakes, pies, cookies, sauces, cocktails, and everything in between.

Since we’re in prime pumpkin season, we figure it’s as good a time as any to expound on the excellence of Trader Joe’s Cut Butternut Squash. When you begin with a whole squash at home, you have your work cut out for you. Peeling, chopping, seeding, cleaning… there’s a good amount of effort involved in making Butternuts “recipe ready.” Our Cut Butternut, on the other hand, is peeled, seeded, and cut into evenly sized cubes, making it “recipe-ready” for almost any fall-forward cooking endeavor. Roast, steam, or even cook in the microwave. Purée them, mash them, add them to a casserole. Create sides, soups, and baked goods. The uses for our Cut Butternut Squash are plentiful, as will be your free time when you add this veggie to your repertoire.

Sour cream is created by fermenting cream with lactic acid bacterial cultures that naturally “sour” and thicken the starting cream. It has long been an ingredient in Eastern and Central European cuisines, making its way to the U.S. and U.K. through westward immigration in the 19th and 20th centuries. It has since been kept on hand to tame picante Tex-Mex dishes, as well as make quick dips and silky sauces. With a pure and simple ingredient list, Trader Joe’s Sour Cream delivers the freshest pasteurized cream, milk, corn starch, and live and active cultures ready for you to use on your culinary adventures! Whether you’re shaping a savory dish or building a baked good, each 16-ounce container of Trader Joe’s pleasantly piquant Sour Cream can be found every day in our dairy section.

That’s why we’re such big fans of Trader Joe’s Mango Blueberry Chia Bowl. Made with an ingredient deck that’s exclusively fruit, fruit juice, chia seeds, and water, each bowl starts with a base of tangy mango purée that’s been mixed with coconut cream, passion fruit juice, and black chia seeds. Together, the sweet and tropical notes of the mango and passionfruit play perfectly off of the plush silkiness of the coconut cream and satisfying chewiness of the chia seeds. And when you combine that with the clean and simple flavors of the included whole blueberries and diced mango, you’ve got one magnificent morning on your hands.

The resultant sauce is medium- thick with robust tomato flavor, accented by a bit of nuttiness from the Parmesan and a finishing flourish of basil. Your pasta will be psyched to meet this Sauce.

Depending on the variety, they can have a near endlessly wide variety of flavors, ranging from peppery to nutty, grassy to tart, and everything in between. Some varieties, like Chalkidiki olives from Greece, have a buttery, savory flavor and firm texture that some describe as “meaty.” Here’s where things get really fascinating: as it turns out, one of the best ways to bring olives with that flavor/texture combo to their fullest expression is to grill them, more or less like you would meat on a skewer.

A bit of pectin is added to lend the sweet, slightly tangy Preserves a bit of body, ensuring supreme spreadability atop your carb of choice (it’s especially good on toasted Braided & Sliced Brioche). Take an unexpected turn into savory territory by mixing some Preserves with an equal amount of chopped Hot & Sweet Jalapeños and showcase the resulting relish on a turkey burger—the fruity & sweet-meets-heat vibe is irresistible.

Romaine leaves bring excellent crunch to a burger or sandwich, and are an excellent option for using as a wrap or lettuce cup. Did you know? Romaine Hearts can even be grilled! Wash the whole Heart, then split it in half and brush with olive oil, grill just until char marks appear, then sprinkle with salt and pepper and serve with or without salad dressing. Now that’s what we call Heart-warming!

From the sweet, sarsaparilla-y flavor of the soda to the creaminess of the vanilla ice cream, every sip summons a certain nostalgia that’s hard to top. Trader Joe’s Root Beer Float Bars take this soda-fountain classic a step further by marrying all the fun flavors of a float with the portability of an ice pop. Constructed like an orange-and-cream 50/50 bar, they’re fundamentally quite simple—rectangular, root beer-flavored ice pops, filled with vanilla ice cream and served on a stick. (See? Simple.) Whether you’re lounging by the pool, hosting a BBQ, or enjoying a leisurely stroll on a warm summer evening, these whimsical treats are capable companions for a trip down memory lane.

In addition to providing an impressive two grams of fiber and three grams of protein per two-slice serving, this mix makes the bread soft and flavorful, instead of tough or grainy. In fact, we specifically chose this bread to appeal to non-gluten-free customers just as much as the gluten-free crowd. Because when it comes to bread, you shouldn’t have to compromise.

        "description": " When in you’re in the mood for a simple, goes-with-everything kind of protein, you can’t go wrong with a nice piece of grilled chicken. The only trouble, of course, is that when you’re in that something-scrumptious-yet-simple kind of mood, you usually don’t have the time or the temperament to fire up a grill. That’s why we offer our frozen Trader Joe’s Grilled Chicken Strips. Each bag contains a pound of fully-cooked white chicken meat that’s been seasoned with just a touch of savory spices, then cut into highly servable strips. And since they only take a few minutes in the microwave or on the stovetop to go from frozen to steamy, juicy, and ready-to-eat, it’s never been easier to put protein on your plate.\n \nIf you regularly prep school or work lunches, you’ll especially appreciate how quick, convenient, and tasty these tender, flavorful, Grilled Chicken Strips are. They pair well with all kinds of veggies and starches, and take particularly well to customizing with your favorite sauces and seasonings—we’re partial to tossing them with a bit of Korean Gochujang Sauce, ourselves. They’re a great topper for salads, pastas, and pizzas, phenomenal as a filling for tacos and quesadillas, lovely when layered into sandwiches and wraps, and an easy addition to casseroles and baked enchiladas.

Remember to give the bottle a good shake before using – this will ensure the seeds are dispersed throughout the sauce, ensuring maximum seed exposure and an excellent Soyaki experience.

At first glance, this bright white orb of creamy cows’ milk cheese resembles its cousin, the mighty Mozzarella ball; in fact, you might have walked right past the tub in the eight or so years we’ve carried it on our shelves for that very reason. But break open a ball of Burrata, and you’ll be delighted to discover soft, stretchy curds comingling with rich cream in its center, with a touch of sea salt to balance its slightly sweet, milky aroma. Creamy and almost cloud-like, it’s a cheese-lover’s dream, with only the simplest accompaniment needed to allow it to shine. Looking for palatable partners? How about fresh cantaloupe slices and balsamic vinegar? Perhaps some grilled peaches and mixed greens? Or maybe on pizza, with slow roasted tomatoes and basil, a glug of extra virgin olive oil, and a few cracks of sea salt…  NOTE: Since posting, the details of this item may have changed due to fluctuating market prices, federal regulations, currency rates, drought, bandits, rush hour traffic, filibusters, zombie apocalypse, punctilious product developers...Contact our Crew for current price and availability Follow us Copyright © Trader Joe’s 2025.

Our most recent venture in finding vegan versions of normally non-vegan fare brought us to a supplier in Greece, who specializes in plant-based cheese alternatives. They made for us this Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend, which combines a variety of vegan cheese alternatives into a single, peppery, plant-based blend. We were intrigued. Then, when we saw how well it melted (a notoriously difficult feat for non-dairy products), we were hooked. We think you’ll be, too. \n \nSavory, spicy, and remarkably creamy, Trader Joe’s Dairy Free Shredded Spicy Mexican Style Blend is great for any situation that calls for cheese: topping tacos, filling quesadillas, sprinkling over salads—you name it. With its blend of vegan shreds and savory spices, including cayenne, cumin, and dried jalapeño peppers, it brings a pleasant, building heat to any dish it’s added to. While it’s especially suited for Mexican, Tex Mex, or Southwest cuisines, we certainly wouldn’t stop there: try it on a plant-based patty melt with Impossible Burger or a stuffed bell pepper, and you’ll see exactly what we mean.

        "description": " Trader Joe's Ghost Pepper Potato Chips are seriously spicy chips, but if you’re a lover of all things spicy, these will bring pure joy and bliss rather than pain and suffering. Their spiciness is also balanced by the naturally sweet profile of the potatoes themselves—the chili enhances, rather than overwhelms the potato. Crafted exclusively for Trader Joe’s, these are lattice cut chips, so they really hold to their spicy seasoning.

        "description": " According to culinary historians, gyoza (“jiaozi” in Mandarin) were invented by the Chinese. We love good food fusions as much as we love good dumplings, so we developed our very own Thai Vegetable Gyoza. These crescent-shaped dumplings are made from wheat flour wrappers that enfold a flavorfully pungent filling of white cabbage, carrot, chive, white radish, onion – plus a dash of ginger, garlic and soy sauce. Already fully cooked, our Thai Vegetable Gyoza easily fulfill your preparation preference – steam, pan fry, microwave, or add to soup. Our favorite method is to heat oil in a pan (or wok); place the potstickers in the hot pan, bottom side down (creases up), and cook over medium-high until browned and crisped; (optional: carefully turn to brown each side); throw a little water into the pan and cover to steam the dumplings off the pan (take care to not add too much water, as the dough can start to come undone). Serve hot with our Gyoza Dipping Sauce or place atop a bed of greens and dress with simple soy-sesame vinaigrette.

And by that, we mean you won’t need to do so much as break out a mixing bowl! These superbly soft and phenomally fluffy pre-made Omelets are fully cooked and ready to go, requiring as little as 20 seconds in the microwave or a skillet before the Cheddar inside becomes satisfyingly melty.

        "description": " In the spring of 2022, we introduced a three-pack of vegan Oat Chocolate Bars. A dairy-defying feat of deliciousness, the oat-based Chocolate is impossibly smooth and creamy, just like milk chocolate—but without milk! Building upon that bodacious base, our buyer worked with the same bean-to-bar supplier in Colombia to develop a crispy counterpart, in the form of Trader Joe’s Oat Chocolate Bars with Crispy Rice & Cocoa Nibs.\n \nMade with cane sugar, cocoa butter, and 42% cocoa mass (which is more than the 25%-35% typically found in milk chocolate), the addition of ground oats and rice syrup (think oat “milk”) makes these Bars lusciously—dare we say, ludicrously—creamy. Bite into one of these Bars, however, and you’ll experience a terrific textural transition from magnificently smooth, “I-can’t-believe-it’s-not-milk” chocolate to the delightful crunch of the included Crispy Rice and Cocoa Nibs, along with a touch of sea salt. Like their forebears, these Bars are vegan, soy free, gluten free, and kosher (pareve). They’re also presented as a three-pack of individually wrapped bars for easy, on-the-go enjoyment. In short, they’re some of the best non-dairy chocolate bars we’ve tasted, bar none!

        "description": " Licorice has long been a favorite among the candy-eating crowd in Australia and New Zealand , going all the way back to the Victorian Era. It wasn’t until the 1950’s, however, that soft and chewy licorice rose to prominence across Australasia. According to legend, one candy company accidentally created a batch far softer than they meant to, and gave it away to local children for free. It proved to be a tremendous hit, and more than 70 years later, it remains one of the most popular styles of licorice globally. Trader Joe’s Trio of Soft Licorice Twists is of this superbly soft and pleasantly chewy variety, and also contain the additional twist (see what we did there?) of coming in three phenomenally fruity flavors: ripe raspberry, tropical mango, and tart green apple.

        "description": " Trader Joe’s Smoked English Cheddar Cheese with Spring Onion & Chive comes to us from the same supplier as our much-celebrated Cheddar Cheese with Caramelized Onions. From their dairy farm deep within the idyllic English countryside, they make this smoky, savory cheese by starting with a base of creamy farmouse Cheddar that’s been mixed with tasty, herbaceous bits of chive and onion. After the cheese is properly aged, they take the extra step of cold-smoking it over oak chips for several hours, resulting in a marvelous mix of rich flavors and smoky notes —precisely the kind of uniquely scrumptious profile you’d expect from a two-time Trader Joe’s Spotlight Cheese.

This Oatmeal is an unpretentious combination of oats, water, maple syrup, brown sugar, and salt. It has some sweetness, but it’s not too sweet (seven grams of sugar per serving); probably very similar to what you’d make if you started from scratch. Of course, you don’t have to start from scratch, because we took care of that for you. We do things like that. You know, to make your life easier. It’s fun.

        "description": " Ginger is so utterly unique in its flavor, aroma, and even the physical sensations it creates in the mouth, that it almost feels like a culinary gift from nature itself. It’s honestly hard to imagine what global cuisine would look like (or, more importantly, taste like) without this singularly scrumptious root. And now, there’s an easy way to incorporate its inimitable flavor profile to any dish you wish: Trader Joe’s Thai Sweet Ginger Sauce combines the savory, herby sensations of ginger with the rich sweetness of coconut sugar, a touch of pickled garlic, and just a bit of soy sauce to make one seriously versatile condiment. You get sweet, spicy, salty, and garlicky — all in a single sauce.

We’ve cooked everything down to a smooth, slightly chunky sauce that has a bright tomato taste, accented by moderate basil notes. Heat it ‘as is’ and serve over spaghetti, penne, or any kind of pasta. (Thai noodles might make an interesting partner!) Use it as a simmer sauce for chicken breasts or meatballs. Or, let it be the starting point for your own sauce-creation. So many different ways to enjoy this enduring sauce.

        "description": " There’s nothing quite like a big bowl of fresh blueberries in the summertime, but a jar of Trader Joe’s Organic Blueberry Preserves comes pretty close! Our supplier takes wild, organic blueberries, harvested from the Canadian Boreal Forest, and simmers them with organic cane sugar to complement their pleasantly tart and rich blueberry flavor. A bit of pectin is added to lend the sweet, slightly tangy Preserves a bit of body, ensuring supreme spreadability atop your carb of choice (it’s especially good on toasted Braided & Sliced Brioche). Take an unexpected turn into savory territory by mixing some Preserves with an equal amount of chopped Hot & Sweet Jalapeños and showcase the resulting relish on a turkey burger—the fruity & sweet-meets-heat vibe is irresistible. And of course, it’d be right at home as the “J” in a PB&J sandwich.

This Hard Cheese (think Fontina in texture, but with a bit more sharpness) is made with raw cow’s milk; the rind that surrounds the savory, creamy white base is then bathed in a Blueberry purée, adding complementary sweet-tart notes to each pleasantly nutty bite and a contrasting, inky blue hue to the exterior.

Like its culinary cousin Port Salut, Saint Paulin was originally created by Trappist monks in France, and its vibrant exterior is an artifact of the traditional cheesemaking methods that are still employed in its production. As the cheese ages, it’s washed in brine to increase the presence of a particular bacteria strain, which creates an enzyme that helps each wheel of Saintt Paulin develop its mild, buttery flavor, and rich, floral aroma—and also just happens to leave a vibrantly ruddy hue.

It was in the 20th century that spinach first got its “superfood” status – from a comic strip character, no less! And while it was silly when Popeye’s muscles suddenly bulged after eating a can of spinach, there was also, in fact, some truth to that story.

Nutritionally-speaking, what this legume-based pasta offers is almost astonishing. Made with a single ingredient (organic red lentil flour), our Sedanini is packed with 13 grams of protein in every serving. That’s impressive. And delicious. Pair it with our Organic Tomato Basil Marinara or a simple blend of olive oil, garlic, and grated cheese. If you’re looking to change up your pasta patterns, this is a good place to start.

        "description": " When sweet and savory come together successfully, it’s always magical. If you can combine sweet and spicy, specifically, that’s an entirely different level of magic. A few years ago, we achieved such sorcery with a delicately spiced honey sauce that left us dreaming of all the different dishes over which we could drizzle it. With a list so long, we decided to bump up the bottle size (by four ounces!), crank up the heat (it’ll prompt a pleasant ooh after every taste), and offer it for the very same price as the previous, smaller version! This new iteriation of Trader Joe’s Spicy Honey Sauce delivers a harmonious intermingling of rich, aromatic honey and a thrilling kick from chili extract, held together with a bit of vinegar. This has the transformative power to augment sweet and savory dishes alike, turning merely delicious meals into transcendent ones.

Some might say these basics and building blocks are a little less exciting than our more fanciful foodstuffs, but we respectfully disagree. Take Trader Joe’s Organic Powdered Can Sugar, for instance. Made with certified organic cane sugar that’s been pulverized into a super fine powder, this vehemently versatile sweetener serves as the starting point for all sorts of kitchen adventures of your own. And what’s more exciting than that?\n \nDelectably sweet, and with a super soft texture, our Organic Powdered Sugar is especially suited for use in making baked goods. We recommend keeping a pouch handy in the pantry for when the mood strikes to make from-scratch shortbread cookies, frostings for cakes, and glazes for cinnamon rolls. As a finisher, it’s also great for adding visual flair and an extra pop of sweetness to treats like tea cookies, French toast, and Chocolate Croissants. That’s the power of Organic Powdered Sugar!

In fact, only vanilla harvested from islands in the Indian Ocean, like Île Bourbon (now known as Réunion) can be called Bourbon Vanilla.

        "description": " When you visit your neighborhood Trader Joe’s, you’ll find a whole host of culinarily adventurous fare, inspired by cuisines from all over the globe, all sold at tremendous values. We’re also proud, however, to offer an ever-expanding list of everyday staples and standbys, similarly priced to be the best value possible. Some might say these basics and building blocks are a little less exciting than our more fanciful foodstuffs, but we respectfully disagree. Take Trader Joe’s Unbleached Enriched All-Purpose Flour, for instance. Made from a base of unbleached, ground wheat, and enriched with vitamins and minerals like iron, niacin, and folic acid for an extra nutritional nudge, this Flour serves as the starting point for all sorts of kitchen adventures of your own. And what’s more exciting than that?\n \nWhen we say All-Purpose, we mean it: whether you’ve got biscuits to bake, pizza dough to throw, or cutlets to dredge, our Unbleached Flour will get the job done. Keep a bag handy for whenever the mood strikes to put together a pie crust, construct a cake, or fashion some fresh pasta noodles. And for soups, stews, and sauces, a bit of our Flour will make a right-as-rain roux, too.

Oh, boy. It’s time. This classic, Indian(ish) dish features chunks of chicken that have been roasted in an oven, or tandoor, and served in a creamy, mildly spicy, tomato-based, curry flavored sauce. A wee bit of investigation reveals that there is no standard for this iconic dish. In fact, our research found that the only thing a majority of recipes for this dish have in common is chicken. This fact rocked our culinary sensibilities, but not as much as the stories that suggest (rather convincingly) that this classic curry was created not in India, but in Great Britain. We don’t have proof, but the sources seem pretty reliable.

        "description": " “How, exactly, has Trader Joe’s made a vegan version of a classically pescatarian dish like poke?”, you may be asking. The answer revolves around something of a textural magic trick. If you’ve never partaken of poke before, it’s a traditional Hawaiian treat made with raw, cut-up fish, marinated in a variety of sauces and seasonings. As it turns out, roasted beets have a remarkably similar texture to sashimi-grade tuna, especially when marinated in a mixture of soy sauce and sesame oil—firm, yet delicate. So, that’s how Trader Joe’s Vegan Poke evokes the tender, toothsome texture and superbly saucy flavors of poke, while still maintaining an entirely plant-based ingredient deck.

Handcrafted with fresh Wisconsin goat milk sourced from local farms, aromatic vanilla bean and sweet vanilla sugar are added to the cheese when it’s removed from the brine. Over a few weeks of aging, the cheese develops notes of toasted caramel, coconut, and nutmeg, and the vanilla bean specks elegantly dot the edible rind, resulting in a fantastically fancy fromage that’s more than ready for its cheese board close-up.

In fact, they’re so beloved, that plant-based variations have been in high demand for nearly as long as their chicken- based counterparts. And while we’ve enjoyed many a Buffalo cauliflower floret over the years, they’ve always felt different than a traditional Buffalo wing—delicious, of course, but in a distinctly different category. With this in mind, we recently reached out to one of our suppliers, an expert in plant-based proteins, and gave them this challenge: a vegan, Buffalo-style appetizer that truly captures the feeling of a crisp, fresh-from-the-fryer Buffalo wing. They proudly came back with Trader Joe’s Buffalo Style Chickenless Wings.

        "description": " The Dolomite mountain range of Italy is a renowned destination for skiers, cyclists and even stair climbers – it’s home to the Calà del Sasso, the world’s longest staircase open to the public at 4,444 steps. The Dolomite mountain range is also renowned for its cheeses, and happens to be the home of Trader Joe’s Italian Bigonda Cheese with Herbs.\n \nOur Bigonda Cheese is made for us by a master cheese-making family in the Trentino province, with over 80 years of experience under their belts. The milk used in the making of this cheese comes from cattle that graze on the breathtaking mountain pastures of the Dolomites. The clean air and lush mountain grasses help the cows produce supremely fresh milk, ideal for making this traditional style of Italian farmstead cheese, known as caciotta, that has a semi-soft texture with a creamy, firm consistency. While there are variations on the style (some cheese makers add black pepper or olive oil), our Bigonda Cheese is studded with laurel, thyme, parsley, organic chives, fennel and caraway seeds, juxtaposing fragrant Herbs with the slightly sweet, fresh milk notes of the cheese. \n \nThe beauty of Bigonda is its versatility – you can melt it into an omelet or on a grilled cheese sandwich, or try it cut into cubes atop a green salad with extra virgin olive oil, garbanzo beans and thinly sliced red onion. Liven up a cheese plate with sliced Bigonda and a foil of sweet fig jam, crunchy Marcona almonds and crisp white wine.

It’s a traditional Cheddar, made using the time-honored “cheddaring” process first employed in the English village of Cheddar (yes, there is such a place, in Somerset). Traditional cheddaring involves putting the cheese curds through a mill after they’ve been cut and turned. It’s a time and labor intensive process that yields a significantly more complex cheese than you get from more “modern” cheddaring methods like stirring the curds.

More and more customers have been asking for less and less—when it comes to sugar content, and other nutritional aspects considered by some to be less than desirable. And so, we decided to create some Dark Chocolate Covered Almonds with notably less of the less desirable stuff—while still providing a really significant snacking experience.

Case in point: Wildfire Blue. Made by the expert cheesemaking team at Carr Valley Cheese, this Wisconsin blue starts with a classically creamy, perfectly salty, remarkably expressive blue cheese profile, complete with rich blue veins streaked throughout. They then take things to the next level with the addition of pepperoncini pepper flakes, turning the cheese into a masterclass in multi- faceted flavors. Each soft, melt-in-your-mouth bite becomes a marvelous mix of creaminess, fiery heat, and ripe blue notes of salted caramel—in other words, a combination that will light up your senses like wildfire.

        "description": " Trader Joe’s Kung Pao Chicken combines dark meat chicken with crunchy green & red bell peppers, onions, dried chili powder, water chestnuts and peanuts. What makes this Kung Pao so distinctive, though, is the sauce. Traditionally, sauces for this dish are rich and savory and can range from mildly spicy to sound-the-alarm-and-grab-a-hose hot. Ours falls in the medium-spicy range—the dish will taste substantially hotter if you actually eat the chili pieces, and a little less hot if you push the chilies to the side of the plate and treat them as a garnish. We think the heat level in our sauce makes it easy to share among friends who fall on opposite sides of the spicy spectrum. If really spicy is your thing, though, you can always add your favorite spicy condiment and even more chili peppers to the finished dish.

Cheesemakers simply take the whey left from whipping up batches of other types of cheese, drizzle in whole milk, an acid of some sort (in our case, acetic acid), and begin cooking the whey mixture. This causes curds to coagulate, grow, and solidify. Finally, the curds are strained of the remaining whey and you’re left with freshly made, fluffy, white Whole Milk Ricotta Cheese.

Next the Turkey is slow smoked over applewood and other hardwoods for several hours. Then it’s sliced and packaged and, voilà! Bacon. And just like pork bacon, you can cook it in a skillet, in the oven, or in the microwave.

Fresh garlic cloves, canola oil, salt and lemon juice are slowly blended together to create an emulsion, which sounds simple in theory, but is actually a time-and-effort intensive process to ensure the oil and lemon juice are properly incorporated. And as anyone who’s attempted to make mayonnaise or hollandaise sauce from scratch can attest, the finished product doesn’t always turn out as intended. With Trader Joe’s Garlic Spread-Dip, the hard work is done for you, so you can just open the container, scoop and eat.

Chef Kundan Lal Gujral was basically playing with a tandoor, a clay oven that conducts super high heat. Primarily used for baking bread, he was testing out how it might treat chicken. So, he would coat chicken pieces with yogurt, skewer them and place them in the tandoor...Tandoori Chicken came to be. Butter, here is where it gets better. To avoid letting leftover tandoori chicken get dry, he crafted a rich, silky (thank you, butter) tomato- and onion-based sauce with which he could enliven the meat, and thus was born the beloved Butter Chicken.

        "description": " The great baking debate: Chips vs. Chunks vs. Chopped – chocolate, that is. We like to engage in all discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to create Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory (in cookies, let’s say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some “chocolate debris” from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also sensational for snacking. You don’t need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all.

They can be enjoyed simply on their own, as part of a delectably elevated hot dog, or incorporated into pasta dishes, sauces, soups, or even hearty breakfast hashes. For a true treat, try crumbling the contents of a Sausage or two into a pan and sautéeing before using as a prime pizza topping.

To wit: each canister starts with Roasted, Salted Almonds. You might call this the melody part, or the “control” variety, against which the other flavors are contrasted—though there’s definitely nothing basic-tasting about them! These high-quality California almonds have been expertly roasted with just the right amount of salt to bring out their inherent nuttiness. For the second variety in this Trio, we’ve chosen Sesame Honey Almonds. Acting as the upper part, they’re rolled in a mixture of sugar, butter, salt, cocoa, and honey, with tiny, crunchy, Thai sesame seeds to give every bite a heightened sense of savory and sweet. Bringing in the lower part are our Caramel Coffee Almonds, coated with coffee powder and glazed with caramel for a sweet, strong-coffee flavor that offers a deep, resonant counterpoint to the underlying nutty notes. This is a Trio of flavors that’s fantastic by the handful, and an ideal partner for the fizzy, festive beverages of the season, such as our Sugar Plum Sparkling Beverage.

Indulgent, decadent, rich, innovative, and often unique offerings can be found on shelves and racks throughout the store. We take tremendous pleasure in the development and delivery of each of these marvelous mouthfuls (mouths-full?), from the simplest to the most painstakingly crafted unicorn of a confection. Trader Joe’s Minty Cocoa Truffles exist, in our stores, as both simple and painstakingly crafted, and each one delivers pure, crisp satisfaction wrapped in lusciously creamy chocolatey cocoa.\n    \nThe idea for these Truffles came from an item we offer in our stores every day—they’re often referred to as “the cocoa truffles in the red box.” TJ’s classics from way back, while undeniably delicious, they’re pretty basic. These Minty Cocoa Truffles take that same base confection and add a cool minty flavor factor and crunchy pearl sugar bits for texture to make something familiar—yet entirely new. We’re in love with these, and we hope you will be, too.

So you can imagine the kind of culinary adventures that are possible when you’ve got two bottles of truffle oil in tow! That’s precisely what you’ll find in Trader Joe’s Truffle Oil Duo—a convenient two-pack of olive oils, one flavored with bold & rich black truffle, the other flavored with delicately savory and aromatic white truffle. They’re made for us by a supplier in Italy, who hunts for and harvests their own truffles, then uses an ingenious, rapid-drying process to help them retain as much of their uniquely earthy and umami flavor as possible before infusing them into Italian olive oil. \n    \n Unlike most of the olive oils we sell, our Truffle Oil Duo isn’t meant to be used for cooking, but rather is best employed as a finishing oil. For example, you might drizzle a bit of the black truffle Oil over a seared ribeye steak, or spoon a bit of the white truffle Oil over a plate of fresh pasta.

        "description": " Made using traditional methods and under extraordinarily exacting standards, Trader Joe’s Platinum Aged Balsamic Vinegar is crafted for us in Modena, Italy, using the concentrated must of Trebbiano and Lambrusco grapes which were grown in the Reggio Emilia region. A small percentage of red wine vinegar is added, and it’s aged for a minimum of three years in oak wood barrels (per its “Invecchiato” designation). According to the Protected Geographical Indication certification, this traditional vinegar-making process is carefully monitored by a group known as the Balsamic Consortium (who knew?), which strictly regulates every detail—from grape varietals, growing regions and how the grapes are grown, to aging methods and more. The result is a rich Balsamic Vinegar with viscous, honey-like texture and flavor that is richly sweet with a gentle line of acidity.

Astounding Multi-Flavor Joe-Joe’s take that goodness to an entirely new level—one with even more chocolate and more flavor combinations to enjoy.\n    \nEach hexagonal prism-shaped box contains four different iterations of the Joe-Joe, all enrobed in a complementary chocolate, with hand-placed drizzles or sprinkles or stripes to further enhance both the taste and the appearance. Our tasting panel proudly proclaimed the mix of cookie flavors in this box a winner; its repeated recurrence in our stores at holiday time proves the proclamation. Every box contains the following: Peanut Butter Joe-Joe’s in milk chocolate with dark chocolate drizzle, Vanilla Joe-Joe’s in ginger-infused white chocolate with ginger cookie sprinkles, Double Chocolate Joe-Joe’s in dark chocolate with milk chocolate drizzle, and Candy Cane Joe-Joe’s in dark chocolate with peppermint sprinkles.

        "description": " Tradition is foundational to the holidays, no matter your background. When it comes to Trader Joe’s holiday products, part of our tradition is to partner with producers who have plenty of experience in making whatever it is they make. For example, we found some candy cane crafters who have been in the business for one hundred years. With just one lick of a Trader Joe’s Handmade Candy Cane, you can tell that tradition is hard at work!\n    \nIronically, their deep candy tradition has produced for us a very unique—one might even say, untraditional Candy Cane. Unlike mass market-produced candy canes that are concocted with high-fructose corn syrup and artificial flavors, our red-and-white-striped Candy Canes are made with peppermint oil, tapioca syrup, and colors derived from red radish. They are hand-pulled, which gives them a beautiful sheen, and they’re generously sized (read: big!). Perhaps the most decidedly untraditional aspect of Trader Joe’s Handmade Candy Canes is the fact that after a bunch of licks, you’ll encounter a soft, Cocoa Crème filling. Yum!\n    \nThese Handmade Candy Canes make wonderful stocking stuffers, and they are also pretty impressive when included as part of a holiday gift basket. Hand them out as party favors, or use them to decorate your table for a party. Heck, you can even hang them on your Christmas tree—if a tree happens to be part of your tradition.

Rather than decorating the front, the underside of these snappy Cookies is coated in a sweet, white fudge icing—the perfect juxtaposition to its spiced flavor profile. Complete with molasses and crystallized ginger, these snappy snaps add a festive touch to holiday cookie platters, and their sturdy structure renders them irresistibly dippable when paired with hot coffee or Cinnamon Spiced Coffee.

        "description": " What could be better than a perfectly spiced, luxuriously soft-textured, rich and molasses-y gingerbread? How about two pieces of gingerbread sandwiching a delicious layer of sweet vanilla frosting? That’s exactly what we did with Trader Joe’s Gingerbread Sandwich Cookies. Our supplier starts with soft-baked gingerbread cookies that are topped with coarse sugar crystals to give them some extra sweetness and a satisfying crunch. They then take two of those cookies and place in between them a generous layer of frosting made with butter, cream cheese, and real vanilla beans from Madagascar.

Trader Joe’s French Green Beans, however, are the real deal. They’re grown for us by a trusted French produce supplier, who flash-freezes them at the very peak of their freshness, to ensure that once you heat them up at home, they’ll be as sweet and tender as they’d be if you’d picked them yourself.\n \nWell suited for serving as a side dish, especially when paired up with some diced onions and Slivered Almonds, we’re particularly fond of their extra fine profile, which gives each bite a crisp, satisfyingly snappy texture. During the holidays, they’re a great option for featuring in a classic green bean casserole, and can be pickled, blanched, or deep-fried any other time of year. For a quick, elevated veggie dish, give them a light steam before sautéeing in olive oil with lemon zest, salt, and pepper, then top with Shaved Parmiggiano Reggiano.

And it makes sense— fall is peak apple season, with fresh crops coming off the trees by the bushel, their sweet-tart flesh and delicious crunch ready to elevate the ever-so-humble pie crust to another level entirely. Trader Joe’s Apple Crumble Pie is a prime example of such pie perfection. Its filling of tender, Northern Spy apples is imbued with warm cinnamon, and nestled between an all-butter pastry crust shell and a crunchy, buttery oat crumble topping with notes of brown sugar. It can be warmed in the oven while you enjoy Thanksgiving Dinner, or served at room temperature with a cup of coffee the next morning. And at eight inches in diameter, it can easily serve six dinner guests (with or without a scoop of TJ’s Super Premium French Vanilla Ice Cream). Apple Crumble Pie for the win!

The Salt crystals are small, delicate, and flaky— the name means salt flower in Portuguese. This Salt contains more moisture than traditional sea salt. It’s preserved in a ceramic crock and topped with a cork lid, which helps protect the crystals and keep them from drying out—it’s a terrific vessel that makes this salt tremendously giftable, and also offers countless re-use options once you’ve enjoyed the contents.

        "description": " The word bulgogi literally means “fire meat” in Korean. The meat of choice in this popular dish is typically beef, sliced into thin strips, marinated in bulgogi sauce (basically a doctored soy sauce), and “fired” on a grill. We love this dish, and have explored some of our own versions, like Trader Joe’s Korean Inspired Bulgogi Beef Fried Rice with Kimchi to name just one. Continuing our exploration, we’ve chosen some less traditional territory in the creation of Trader Joe’s Korean Beefless Bulgogi.

        "description": " Drawing inspiration from the dish known across Greece and Cyprus as pilafi pourgouri, Trader Joe’s Bulgur Pilaf with Butternut Squash and Feta Cheese is a side dish for the ages. Each batch starts with a base of light, nutty bulgur wheat, which our supplier seasons with aromatic spices like thyme and turmeric. They then cook it in a mild vegetable broth with bits of sweet and earthy butternut squash until the bulgur takes on a tender, easy- going texture, before finally tossing it all with chunks of tart, tangy, feta cheese. Each forkful offers a variety of textures, from the soft bite of the squash, to the fluffiness of the bulgur, and the teeth-sinking satisfaction of the feta, all bound together by a delightfully savory flavor profile that pairs excellently with practically any protein.

This uptick in vegan versions of our classic dips and spreads is no mere happenstance—it’s part of a concerted effort to make more options available to our customers who don’t eat dairy or meat. And now, we’re proud to introduce our first foray into plant-based seafood with Trader Joe’s Vegan Salmonesque Spread. Made with a base of dairy-free cream cheese, to which our supplier adds savory bits of plant-based smoked salmon, chopped dill, and tart, briney capers, each bite of this Spread effortlessly evokes the flavors of our classic Smoked Salmon Dip, all without containing any salmon—or any other animal-based products, for that matter. It’s downright Salmonesque!

        "description": " A holiday tradition dating back all the way to 17th century England, Sage Derby is well beloved in Britain for its savory, herbaceous taste, firm, buttery texture, and unmistakable green hue. Trader Joe’s Sage Derby (pronounced DAR-bee, across the pond) is crafted especially for us by a small, family-owned cheesemaker in Lancashire, who hand-blends the Cheddar curds with a mix of earthy, aromatic sage and spinach (for color). Each wedge has a marvelously marbled, and—if we dare say so ourselves—charmingly festive appearance, ideal for serving on cheese plates of all kinds.

The wheel is coated in cinnamon, providing just the right amount of sweet spiciness to complement this savory and slightly tangy cheese. Shavings of Toscano create the perfect topping for a crostini.

        "description": " Salt is likely the single most important mineral in human culinary history—and probably human existence more broadly. The fact that we very much need it for our brains and bodies to function properly aside, salt is essential in preserving food, in killing foodborne pathogens, and in allowing the flavor receptors on our tongues to fully perceive sweet, sour, and umami tastes. Across time and countless cultures, salt has held immeasurable social, economic, and religious importance, and provided the etymological inspiration for words like sauce, sausage,  salad, salacious, and salary (among many others). All this to say: salt is pretty darn important! So it might as well be easy to work with, like it is with Trader Joe’s Sea Salt Crystals.\n \nMade with hefty-sized sea salt crystals sourced from South Africa, our Sea Salt comes in a jar with a convenient grinder already attached. Which means that all it takes to add just the right amount of salt to any kind of dish is a couple of satisfyingly crackly spins of the lid. Since it’s such a crucial part of any pantry, we’re proud to say that our Sea Salt is of dependably excellent quality, and sells for an equally excellent everyday price.

        "description": " In the world of fiction, bread crumbs are most famously associated with the fairy tale of Hansel and Gretel. In that story, two wayward tots used them as a tool to keep track of their progress in the forest, only to find that birds had eaten them when they attempted to backtrack. What does this tell us about bread crumbs? If nothing else, they’re much more delicious than they are a useful geolocational tool. Trader Joe’s Organic Bread Crumbs are certainly delicious, and they’re made with organic ingredients to boot. And they’re definitely better suited for the kitchen than orienting yourself in the woods—just in case that was still on your mind. \n \nWhether you’re in the mood for making fried fish, meatloaf, or a cheesy casserole, it’s always an excellent idea to keep a pouch of our Organic Bread Crumbs on hand. They add much-needed body and texture to crab cakes, meatballs, and salmon patties, a delightfully crispy pop of texture when used to top baked mac and cheese, and make a superlatively delicious breading for pork cutlets, chicken cordon bleu, or air-fried pickles. Head on over to your Trader Joe’s grocery aisle to pick up a pouch today—we just wouldn’t recommend using them to find your way back home, is all.

Luckily, our Buyers weren’t bugged by such a challenge. They searched and searched for natural sources for organic sprouts, and lo behold, eventually found the key: coastal farms. Cool, coastal micro-climates serve as a natural pest repellant, keeping the bugs at bay. We’ve since partnered with experienced farmers, to bring you Trader Joe’s Organic Brussels Sprouts.\n \nGrown with care in pristine, mineral-rich fields, without the use of any synthetic pesticides or chemical fertilizers, these certified Organic Sprouts are quite something. They’re as rich in flavor as they are nutrients (an excellent source of vitamins C and K, a good source of vitamin A, folate, manganese, dietary fiber... the list goes on), and make an ideal side for practically any protein you can name. They can be prepared in countless different ways, but are particularly delicious when halved, tossed with olive oil, salt, pepper, and thinly sliced garlic, then roasted lightly browned on the bottom.

        "description": " The great baking debate: Chips vs. Chunks vs. Chopped – chocolate, that is. We like to engage in all discourse around baking, especially when it comes to chocolate, but to do so knowledgeably, we needed to create Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks. Made from 58.9% cocoa, a higher percentage than our chips, these chunks balance rich, dark chocolate with the perfect amount of sweetness. Unlike chips, these chunks are not formulated to hold their shape, so they melt more easily, thus covering more territory (in cookies, let’s say). And because they are irregularly shaped, you can expect some “chocolate debris” from chunks, but significantly less than if you were to chop the chocolate yourself. In summary, Trader Joe’s Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chunks promise premium chocolate flavor, are easily prepared and measured, and melt smoothly & quickly, which makes them exceptional for baking and candy making. They are also sensational for snacking. You don’t need to bake to enjoy great chocolate, after all.

Buttery, soft-ripened Triple Cream Brie is a delight on all its own, but by adding in the piquant pop of Green Peppercorns (i.e., black peppercorns before they’re blanched and dried), our supplier, an expert cheesemaker based in Germany, has created something entirely unique: a cheese that’s rich, creamy, zesty, and even just a touch spicy, all at once.

So named for the Italian word for “little waterfall”, Cascatelli don’t just resemble an awe-inspiring natural phenomenon, they’ve become something of a phenomenon in their own right. An international sensation since their debut in 2021, they were designed by an American food journalist intent on creating the perfect pasta shape based on three criteria: forkability (the ease with which one can pick up and hold the pasta on your fork), sauceability (their ability to retain sauce), and toothsinkability (a satisfyingly toothsome texture). Trader Joe’s Organic Cascatelli, we’re excited to tell you, passes all three tests with flying colors.

Traditionally made from a mix of fermented soybeans, rice, barley, salt, and, of course, spicy red peppers, gochujang has a thick consistency and a delightfully complex flavor that’s a rare mix of savory, sweet, and spicy, all at once. In the case of Trader Joe’s Gochujang, we reached out to a supplier in South Korea who uses traditional fermentation techniques to achieve this uniquely delicious flavor profile, resulting in a highly versatile pepper paste that works just as well as a condiment as it does a soup base, a marinade, a dipping sauce, and so much more.

Bok choy is a cruciferous vegetable (a relative of cabbage) that’s loaded with vitamins A, C, and K, as well as folate and calcium. Unique to bok choy among its peers, interestingly, is the bioavailability of its calcium (how much can actually be absorbed by the human body). A full 54% of bok choy’s calcium can be absorbed by the body. By way of comparison, the figure for spinach, a very healthy green, is just five percent. It’s even higher than milk, which comes in at 32%.\n\nYou can use Baby Bok Choy in soups and stir-frys, salads and side dishes. Slice it into long strips for stir-fry, blend it into a chopped salad, or sauté it in a bit of olive oil and garlic for a slightly sweet, crisp veggie side that will enliven any meal. Now you know.

        "description": " A staple of many North American Chinese restaurant menus, most sources agree that General Tsao’s Chicken (sometimes spelled Tso or Zuo) was invented in New York in the 1970s by chef Peng Chang-kuei. Though it has no historical relation to the real General Tsao Tsung-T’ang, a 19th century military leader from Hunan and prominent figure in the Taiping Rebellion, it’s likely it was named in his honor as a nod to its creator’s Hunan roots, and specialization in Hunanese cuisine. In turn, Trader Joe’s General Tsao Stir Fry Sauce is a nod to this sweet and lightly spicy comfort food favorite, bringing you the same bright flavors and satisfying heat that have delighted diners on crispy chicken for nearly 50 years.\n\nIndeed, our General Tsao Sauce is quite delicious when served over battered and fried chicken, but that’s just a starting point. It also makes a great base for stir fries of all kinds, an excellent dipping sauce with dumplings or crispy veggies, and a phenomenal marinade for pork, poultry, beef, or fish. For a quick, easy, and sweetly spicy side, simply toss some steamed broccoli or cauliflower with a few tablespoons of this Sauce and serve. Delicious!

        "description": " Did you know? Greek yogurt isn’t specifically “Greek”, per se—it simply has that reputation due to the fact that a yogurt company with origins in Greece was one of the first to introduce yogurt to the U.S. that had most of its liquid strained out (called straggisto in Greece). While not solely a Greek invention, this technique is certainly popular in Greece, and elsewhere around the globe, since the straining process leaves it with its signature tangy yogurt flavor, but a texture closer to that of sour cream.\n\nAll that said: we love Greek yogurt. The tang! The texture! And we know you love it, too, because we sell more Greek style yogurt than you can shake a strainer at. Trader Joe’s Greek Yogurts are made for us by a “yogurteria” that scores big on tang, texture, and of course, value!\n\nOur Plain Whole Milk Greek Yogurt is made, as one might expect, using whole milk, so it’s a “full fat” yogurt. Its rich flavor and thick, yet smooth, consistency are ideal complements to the inherent tanginess of Greek style yogurt. It’s luscious, flavorful, and creamy, high in protein (7-10 grams per serving, depending on flavor), and contain cultures like L. Bulgaricus, L. Acidophilus, and Bifidus to aid in healthy digestion.

Some “Greek-style” yogurts come by their creaminess via thickeners or gums. Not this one. TJ’s Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is strained, as tradition dictates, to remove much of the liquid whey, leaving a thicker, creamier yogurt.\n\nOur Nonfat Plain Greek Yogurt is also higher in protein than classic, European-style yogurts – each eight ounce serving has 22 grams of protein! Add in some fresh or frozen fruit and a little granola for a hearty breakfast. Add a bit of honey for a satisfying snack. Blend into a smoothie to add a touch of tartness to that sweet treat. Or use it in place of sour cream on tacos or baked potatoes.

As the story goes, a hotel chef in San Francisco (circa 1923) wanted to pay tribute to his actor friend who was appearing in a play by William Archer called “The Green Goddess.” He concocted a creamy, green-tinted dressing that was to be the inspiration for many dressings to come.

Simultaneously sweet, refreshing, and texturally satisfying, a typical sip of a boba drink starts with the cool rush of iced, sweetened, and often fabulously flavored milk (or a comparable non-dairy beverage) and ends on a delightfully chewy note, courtesy of the tapioca pearls (A.K.A. boba) that mingle at the bottom of the cup. It’s a taste-texture combo that serves as an ideal anytime treat, especially when combined with a savory snack. And now, thanks to Trader Joe’s Instant Boba Kit, it can be enjoyed from the comforts of your very own home.

And they’re also never given antibiotics, or added hormones. We could stop there... but we won’t! Each thinly sliced piece of Turkey is tender, savory, and has a delicate Hickory smokiness to it that pairs especially well with a nice, sharp Cheddar—like our Organic New Zealand Cheddar, for instance—and even better when that pairing comes together in the form of a warm turkey melt.

        "description": " We have some big news. Our latest Olive offering is so enormous that we stuffed them with not one, but two bold flavors. Introducing Trader Joe’s Garlic & Jalapeño Stuffed Olives! We scoured the globe to find an Olive with firm, meaty flesh, and a buttery, briny flavor—and we found them in a small port city along the Aegean Sea in Greece. These enormous Greek, green Chalkidiki Olives have been pitted and Stuffed with tangy pickled Jalapeño and Garlic that offer a gentle kick in one big bite. They’re exciting snacks on their own and really add pizzazz to pizza, sandwiches, and salads when chopped up to make a homemade tapenade. And best yet, they’ll make an exceptional and slightly spicy addition to your next martini.

Originally the brainchild of a historic, Italian dairy and a well-known cheesemaker, these extra-crunchy nuggets are boldly cheesy, packed with protein (15 grams per serving), and all but carb-free (less than one gram per serving). And thanks to some nifty, patented baking technology, these Cheese Bites are completely shelf-stable, even without the use of preservatives.

They then bake them to a perfectly pleasing soft texture, which not only interacts wonderfully with the crunch of the seeds, but accentuates its interplay of sweet and savory flavors, too.

This gives each Pistachio a delightfully crunchy texture that interplays impeccably with their naturally mild, buttery flavor profile, which in turn is accentuated by the addition of sea salt. They arrive at our stores in the shell, which suits us just fine, since they’re just as fun to crack open as they are to eat.

This was very intentional, as our tasting panel painstakingly formulated the best balance between coated and not (with some additional, creamy, yogurt chunks thrown in) for just the right amount of tangy-sweet yogurt flavor. And then there are freeze-dried strawberries, which impart authentic strawberry flavor; especially as your milk or non-dairy beverage re-hydrates them right there in your cereal bowl! Our Strawberry Yogurt O’s are low in sodium, an excellent source of vitamin C and Iron, and they’re made without artificial flavors or preservatives.

        "description": " Trader Joe's Layered Beef Tostada takes one toasted flour tortilla (tostada literally means “toasted”), and stacks it with typical taco ingredients, and then another toasted flour tortilla. Between the two tortillas, there’s enchilada sauce and savory ground beef, with seasonings that include cumin, paprika, onion, oregano, and cayenne. There are also whole pinto beans (rather than refried), along with two different kinds of cheese: Cheddar and Monterey Jack. Finally, the top toasted tortilla is itself topped with diced tomatoes, sliced black olives, green onions, and more cheese. Delicious!

        "description": " After 10 years as one of the MVPs of the TJ’s cheese case, one might think that our Unexpected Cheddar’s ability to surprise would have waned, somewhat. Then Trader Joe’s Unexpected Cheddar Chicken Sausage came along. Which isn’t to say that it’s necessarily shocking that cheese and chicken go well together, of course, but the degree to which this Parmesan-like Cheddar pairs with the flavor of savory-seasoned, lightly smoked chicken, sweet bits of caramelized onions and red pepper, and the satisfying snap of a natural pork casing? That’s nothing short of astonishing.\n\nFully cooked and ready to reheat, Trader Joe’s Unexpected Cheddar Chicken Sausages can be grilled, steamed, or pan-fried, and serve beautifully on a toasty, buttery bun—especially when adorned with Whole Grain Dijon Mustard or Organic Sweet Pickle Relish. They’re also delicious when sliced into rounds, sautéed, and mixed into hearty soups, breakfast hashes, and creamy pastas dishes. And if you’re feeling really spontaneous, or extra cheesy (or both), it’s especially tasty when served hot with a sprinkling of melty Shredded Unexpected Cheddar on top.

The salmon are raised with care by experienced fish farmers and never given antibiotics in their feed, which you'll find at some fish farms. Norway's frigid waters make for tender, buttery, and well-marbled salmon-after all, fish need fat to keep warm! Thanks to their extra thick, skin-on \"BBQ Cut,\" these Fresh Atlantic Salmon Fillets can really take the heat, and are ideal for grilling, pan-searing, roasting, baking, or poaching. They're great to have on hand for protein-and-omega-rich dinners in a hurry. Simply brush the fish with a bit of olive oil or butter, sprinkle it with salt and pepper, and cook as desired. Depending on how fancy you want to get here, dinner can be ready in as little as 15 minutes.

        "description": " Made for us by an Ohio baker with a reputation for brownie brilliance, Trader Joe’s Brookie is a mouth- watering mash-up of two timeless desserts. The bottom layer is all brownie—a rich dark brown batter, with sweetly fragrant cocoa notes and a pleasantly fudgy chew. That beautiful brownie batter is topped with a layer of golden cookie batter that’s speckled with sweet chocolate chips, and the whole thing is baked to perfection—in this case, perfection is defined as a slightly soft, tender center with a gloriously chewy edge. And because this rectangular bar of Brookie goodness is conveniently pre-cut into eight servings, you’ll get a sweet, soft center and chewy edge, no matter which piece you eat.

And because they’re pretzels, they’re just so satisfying: the crunch, the salt, the subtle maltiness. We’ve found a way to make them even more satisfying, but drenching them in a strawberry yogurt candy coating – some white with pink drizzle, some pink with white drizzle. If you’re a fan of our Strawberry Yogurt O’s cereal, you already know this combination is irresistible. Take that same flavor combo, add even more crunchy texture, and make it mini?

Just in time for summer (you know, pickle season) we’re introducing Trader Joe’s Dill Pickle Mini Falafel—vegan, garbanzo-based Falafel that get pepped up with an herby brightness from their partner, the Dill Pickle. One bite, and you’ll discover a pairing so harmonious, you’d think they were always meant to be enjoyed together. We really wanted to reach peak pickle here, so we’ve taken it a step further and used the pickle brine to hydrate the falafel mix. Pickle-posterous? Maybe. Delicious? Definitely!

Splash it on a classic spinach salad with freshly sliced strawberries, goat cheese and walnuts; or over a platter of sliced beefsteak tomatoes and burrata. Or, steer it into more savory territory tossed in a pasta salad with roasted corn, cubed avocado and cotija cheese; or drizzled atop chicken or shrimp skewers hot off the grill. At a mere 60 calories and 4 grams of sugar per serving, you’ll want to drizzle it on everything this season.

In addition to more patent partners (Ground Beef Patties, anyone?), these slightly sweet Buns are an acclaimed accompaniment to chicken salad, perfect for piling high with pulled pork, and superb simply toasted and slathered with jam. To achieve peak Bun brilliance, we recommend buttering the inside of the buns and grilling for a couple of minutes before building your burger. You’ll be ever so glad you did.

Dorothy worked in the Lena, IL plant, and as she grew to become a cheesemaking pioneer in her own right, she was known to work tirelessly or, as they say, until the cows came home, perfecting her soft-ripened cheeses. One such soft ripened cheese with a velvety mouthfeel, slightly sweet, buttery flavor and earthy aroma, Dorothy’s Comeback Cow can be identified by its characteristic bloomy orange rind and its unique shape. Each wheel of Dorothy’s Comeback Cow is molded into the shape of a flower, a nod to the wild grasses and flowers the cows feed on to produce the flavorful milk that goes into this silky Soft Ripened Cheese—milk which is also rBST-free!

Well, Trader Joe’s Cheeseburger Burrito is here to change all that! To create this momentous meeting of two casual culinary collossi, our supplier takes all the constituent ingredients of a juicy, fully-loaded cheeseburger, including savory-seasoned beef crumble; sharp shredded Cheddar cheese; chopped tomato & onion; and classic condiments like ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish—then wraps them tightly in a flour tortilla. Every bite is full-flavored, satisfying, and marvelously multi- textured, setting a new standard for mealtime mash-ups.

But that doesn’t mean that they can’t be improved upon. For example, while we adore the savory splendor of a perfectly cheesy raviolo, we recognize that they’re not always easy for those who don’t to enjoy. Until today, that is. Trader Joe’s Vegan Spinach & Cashew Ravioli offers the same gloriously cheesy taste and tender texture of traditional ravioli, but does so without the use of dairy — or any other animal-based products, for that matter.\n\nMade for us by a supplier in Italy who’s been in the pasta business for over 140 years, each of these sunflower-shaped Vegan Ravioli are made with egg-free semolina pasta, filled with a mix of hearty sautéed spinach, creamy cashew cheese, and just a sprinkling of breadcrumbs for a little extra oomph in each bite. After a brisk three to four minutes in boiling water, they take on a delightful al dente texture and can be served as simply (with a splash of olive oil and a pinch of crushed red pepper) or as sauce-fully (tossed with warm Vegan Kale, Cashew & Basil Pesto, for instance) as you’d like.

        "description": " Sometimes a burger is just a burger, and sometimes it’s so much more. Trader Joe’s Premium Salmon Burgers most definitely fall into the “so much more” category. What makes them so special? They’re made with wild pink salmon fished from the icy cold waters of Alaska. The fish are fully skinned and deboned, then gently seasoned with such goodies as mirepoix—the classic combination of carrots, celery and onions—and sea salt. They are formed into patties and quick frozen—this locks in moisture and super salmon flavor, resulting in a truly sensational, mild-tasting (read: never fishy), flaky burger. You don’t even need to thaw them; you can grill them from frozen with excellent results. No grill? No problem. Cook them in the oven or on the stovetop with equal ease. Serve them on buns with all the traditional burger accouterments, crumbled over a garden salad, or as center-of-the-plate for a protein-packed repast.

Rather than let them go to waste, they began developing yolk-centered desserts, the most successful of which came to be known as pastel de nata, or, as its known throughout the rest of the world, the Portuguese Custard Tart.

        "description": " A certified staple of Argentinian and Uruguayan cooking, chimichurri is savory, herbaceous, refreshing, and richly aromatic, all at once — truly a consummate condiment, if ever there was one. Though its precise origins are somewhat disputed, food historians generally agree that it rose to prominence as part of Argentinian ranch cuisine, likely sometime in the 19th century, primarily as a way to season grilled beef. Since then, as Trader Joe’s Chimichurri Sauce deftly demonstrates, its uses have expanded to include sandwiches and seafood, burgers and kebabs, pastas and potatoes — pretty much anything that’s savory and delicious will be even more so with a bit of Chimichurri on top.\n\nStarting with a mix of finely chopped parsley and cilantro, our supplier adds in minced garlic, dried cumin, and crushed red pepper, then blends in a mix of oil and vinegar. The resulting Sauce is a compellingly complex mix of herby aromatics, savory spice, silky texture, and even a delicately tart note that serves to wake up the flavors within any entrée it’s added to. We especially like it with grilled shrimp on crispy crostini, al pastor tacos with charred pineapple, roasted sweet potatoes with crumbled cotija, or, of course, a freshly seared steak.

        "description": " Vegan cheese has come a long way in a relatively short amount of time — it wasn’t too long ago that the idea of non-dairy nachos was more or less unheard of. However, thanks to plant-based powerhouses like cashew and coconut, which are especially adept at mimicking the texture of melted cheese, it’s easier than ever to enjoy savory, cheesy treats without the use of animal products. Case in point: Trader Joe’s Organic Vegan Nacho Dip. Soft, spreadable, and decidedly dairy-free, it conjurs all the same familiar flavors of a classic nacho dip, while being made from entirely organic, plant-based, and — we ought to mention — gluten free ingredients.

        "description": " Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the cob known as elote. While the fixins may vary from vendor to vendor, elotes typically come slathered in mayo or a crema-based sauce, rolled in grated cotija or añejo cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero (or making elotes at home) can tell you, it’s a highly craveable combination of flavors that’s sure to leave an impression. It’s left such an impression on us, in fact, that it inspired our exclusive-to-TJ’s snack: Trader Joe’s Organic Elote Corn Chip Dippers.

Then our Tasting Panel took this opportunity to revisit each flavor profile. Where we didn’t match the original flavor profile 100%, we improved the flavor.

Originally served in soy sauce, tteok bok ki took on its modern- day red hue and sweet, peppery flavor profile via one chef ’s introduction of gochujang sauce in the mid-20th century, and has since become a darling of Korean BBQ connoisseurs and street food aficionados the world over. And now, this rich, spicy delicacy of rather royal origins has found a new domain: The freezer aisle at your neighborhood Trader Joe’s. Make way for Trader Joe’s Tteok Bok Ki!

Using the power of eggs combined with a carefully balanced blend of gluten free flours, including brown rice flour, millet flour, and potato starch, each mildly savory Wrap provides all the structure, flexibility, and tender texture of a classic tortilla, and a scant fraction of the carbs — a 60-calorie serving of two Wraps will contain zero net carbs, in fact!

Drizzle it over eggs for breakfast or employ it as a replacement for traditional enchilada sauce in an enchilada bake at dinnertime. Of course, chips are improved with a dip in this salsa (hey, “salsa” is just Spanish for “sauce,” so even though it’s not a salsa, per se, it is technically still a salsa), and its ever-slightly-sweet overtones are delicious with tacos.

Tangy, robust, and marvelously concentrated, our Organic Tomato Paste is so much more than just an occasional add-in for sauces and soups. In addition to its strong, full flavors of tomato, our Paste is naturally rich with alluring notes of umami, which can be used to add a depth of flavor to all sorts of dishes — everything from braised short ribs, to pork fried rice, to shepherds pie can get a lot from adding just a little.\n\nOf course, since it is so flavorful, and since such a little bit goes such a long way, the question often arises: what should you do with any leftovers you may have, after you’ve made what you bought it for? First, we recommend scooping it out, placing it in a freezer-safe sandwich bag, then squeezing as much air out as you can before sealing and placing in the freezer. You can use the rest, bit by bit, for enhancing the flavor of practically any dish that uses ground meat (or plant-based alternatives), or for making quick, homemade ketchups, BBQ sauces, and even Bloody Mary mixes.

While we cannot officially ascribe it this designation (the FDA has yet to rule on what foods may be dubbed “magical,” you see), we do see what folks are getting at—Trader Joe’s All Natural Fresh Mozzarella really is the perfect ball of Mozzarella Cheese.

Perhaps you haven’t given croutons much thought in the past — an entirely understandable position to be in, given that they’re hardly ever the focus of a meal. As purveyors (and appreciators) of food in all its forms, however, we decided to spend some time contemplating their place on the plate, and when we were done, we found that these crunchy toppers of soups and salads had a tremendous amount of untapped potential. For example, what if, instead of a standard loaf of bread, they were made from a buttery, flaky, luxuriously multi-layered croissant? And what if you added an alluringly aromatic herb, like rosemary, to the mix? Shortly after, Trader Joe’s Rosemary Croissant Croutons were born.

Because of this convenience and its deliciousness, our Vegetable Fried Rice is a mainstay for many. It’s packed with vegetables, including carrots, edamame, corn, green peas, leeks, and red bell pepper. Seasoned with soy sauce, rice wine, as well as some sugar, onions, seaweed, salt, and sesame oil – the medley offers rich, rounded flavor. Because the rice has already been cooked, it requires only a simple heating. A couple minutes in the microwave returns fluffy, tender grains, while a handful of minutes in a frying pan or wok (over medium heat) browns the grains and gives them a craveable crispness. Delicious on its own, Vegetable Fried Rice is also a welcoming base for more veggies, fried tofu, TJ’s Mandarin Orange Chicken or TJ’s Mildly Sweet & Spicy Beef and Broccoli.

        "description": " Here to add some heat to sandwiches, charcuterie boards, or homemade mac and cheese, Trader Joe’s Spicy Buffalo Cheddar combines the savory splendor of a classic Cheddar with the satisfying spice of buffalo wing sauce. It’s crafted for us by a specialty cheesemaker in upstate New York (just a little ways away from the city of Buffalo, itself), who mixes their Cheddar with hot sauce and bits of jalapeño, habanero, and dried red pepper flakes, providing a piping hot pop of flavor in every bite. Hot enough for all the heat-seekers out there, but not so blazing as to turn away any casual fans of capsaicin, our Spicy Buffalo Cheddar is a fun, fiery cheese with practically endless uses.

        "description": " So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you’d find in a typical fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you’d expect to find in risotto or paella. Trader Joe’s Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it’s elegantly soft and fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease — the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round out our rice selection.

And it’s USDA Choice Angus Beef — the same quality grade you'll find in our Trader Joe’s Premium Angus Steak program. Generally speaking, this extraordinarily tender cut is best presented with a bit of a seasoning boost, the way filet mignon is often complemented by a rich sauce. Here, our Boneless Roast has been rubbed with a seasoning blend that includes Porcini mushrooms, salt, minced garlic, onion powder, red bell peppers, parsley flakes, and chili peppers.\n\nAll this prep (which we’ve happily done for you!) complements the Beef Loin’s tenderness with a deep, nutty flavor that makes putting this Roast on the table a special event, indeed. You need only pop it in a 375°F oven for about an hour, then let it rest about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

One of the more amusing origin stories we’ve come across traces it back to an American sea Captain Hanson Gregory. The story goes that, on a particularly choppy voyage, Capt. Gregory saw no reason he shouldn’t be able to steer his ship with both his hands and enjoy his favorite baked good at the same time—so he impaled the round, cake-like creation on his steering wheel. You know, like any logical sea Captain would. While we can’t say whether that’s fact or fiction, we can whole-heartedly empathize with Capt. Gregory’s extreme donut devotion. We, too, are known to sail the (culinary) seas, and we, too, LOVE donuts.

Like their PBP (that’s Peanut Butter Pretzel) cousins, every bite is crunchy (outside) and creamy (inside); salty (outside) and a little sweet (inside). This makes them a particularly satisfying solo snack, and a likewise excellent addition to your favorite TJ’s trail mix—you won’t regret keeping a bag in your desk drawer or backpack for either purpose.

But the truth is, it’s actually a garlic bread cheese, inspired by the Finnish delicacy that just happens, by idiomatic coincidence, to pair wonderfully with garlic. It’s crafted for us by master cheesemakers in Wisconsin, who take blocks of rich, thick, cow’s milk cheese, cover them in garlic powder, then bake them to a beautifully golden-brown hue.

        "description": " Trader Joe’s Vegan Creamy Dill Dressing offers all the satisfying flavor and smooth texture of a classically creamy dressing, but does so without the use of any animal products. Starting from a base of cauliflower, almond butter, and vinegar, our supplier builds up an amazingly herby flavor profile via the addition of garlic, shallots, parsley, and chives, then finishes it off with distinctively aromatic dill. The result is one exquisitely silky Vegan Dressing that can be used on salads and sandwiches, or enjoyed as a dipping sauce for all kinds of snacks.

As hearty, filling, and delicious as this classic veggie soup was, we found ourselves wondering if there wasn’t room for improvement. So, we rolled up our sleeves and began working with a supplier to develop an even better version. Just like its previous incarnation, this Trader Joe’s Organic Lentil Vegetable Soup is vegan and organic, but this time, it’s gluten free, too. And if that weren’t enough, it’s even more savory and satisfying — our best Lentil Vegetable Soup yet, if we do say so ourselves.

It’s almost impossible to cut almonds into slivers this regular and uniform at home, using regular kitchen tools, which makes our Slivered Almonds all the more convenient. That’s all the more important, considering that their shape not only looks great when placed atop a cookie, bowl of oatmeal, or salad, but also nicely accentuates their texture and flavor. Whether you’re using them for their visual, culinary, or simple snacking qualities, Trader Joe’s Unsalted Dry Toasted Slivered Almonds are tasty, convenient, and a great value — which is exactly why we’ve kept them on the shelf for over 15 years.

This vibrant salad accompaniment is packed with Hass avocados, fresh herbs like basil, and chives, and seasonings that include green onions, garlic, and apple cider vinegar. Most refrigerated dressings are heat pasteurized for safety. That’s great for safety; not so great for maintaining the fresh flavors of otherwise raw foods. Our supplier uses a process called HPP (that stands for High Pressure Processing), which uses very cold water and very high pressure to achieve the same food safety results, without cooking the ingredients. The result is a dressing with big, bold, bright flavors, and only 20 calories per serving!

The cow’s milk offers a milder flavor than sheep’s milk, while retaining the pleasant tanginess so favored by feta fans. The curds are bathed in a salty brine (think of it as “pickling” but with cheese!), then drained, gently pressed and dried to allow the saltiness to infuse throughout. This process creates a buttery tanginess and a slightly firm texture that crumbles with ease. Crumbly, briny Cheese made with organic milk? Be still our palates!

        "description": " Farmers harvest Trader Joe’s White Quinoa in May at an altitude of about 12,000 feet, then they carefully wash, rinse, dry, clean again and sort the crop by color, before packing it to ship to our stores. Organic White Quinoa is a protein rich alternative to rice, couscous or pasta and is gluten free. This ancient grain has more than 5,000 years of history, and was so prized by the ancient Incas that it earned the designation “the mother grain.” Unlike most grains, Quinoa is a complete protein, meaning it contains all the essential amino acids in a balanced protein. It is often cited as one of the best protein sources in the vegetable kingdom.

Their natural red color (when raw) really makes them stand out visually; their rich, sweet flavor will have you coming back for more. How rich & sweet? These Shrimp boast flavor and texture so similar to that of lobster, you might just think the bag was mislabeled. But no, these are definitely shrimp. They are just excellent, of course, sautéed with olive oil and garlic, scampi-style. Large, with about 20-25 Shrimp per pound, they’re particularly impressive paired with a skewer and a grill or broiler. Baste them with the sauce of your choosing, or simply season them with your choice of spices and serve on a bed of our Spicy Mexican-Style Riced Cauliflower. So. Good.

Each slice of delicately smoked Atlantic salmon is given a generous dusting of crunchy dried garlic and onion, flavorful poppy seeds, and a mix of delightfully nutty black and white sesame seeds. This combo of savory & smoky, soft & crunchy makes it an elevated alternative for any typical smoked salmon application, be it in hors d’oeuvres, eggs benedict, salads, or your standard brunch spread. Why, you can even top a freshly toasted, cream cheese-covered “everything” bagel with a slice or two — because who doesn’t want a little more of everything?

The crispy, crunchy, dried garlic and onion creates a delightfully bold, verging-on-umami base, while dried red bell pepper and chili flakes build onto that with complementary smoky, slightly sweet, subtly spicy notes. Most importantly, however, is the olive oil, which not only binds the other ingredients together, but becomes infused with a balanced blend of all the other flavors, combining them all into one superbly savory seasoning.

        "description": " Translated directly, fusilli is a diminuitive of the Italian fuso, referring to the screw-shaped spindle of an old-fashioned spinning wheel. And much like those spindles of old, this helix-like structure has a highly practical purpose: the twists and turns of each tender piece of Fusilli are perfectly designed to hold onto all kinds of sauces. Which is just one of the reasons why Trader Joe’s Fusilli has been an all-star of our pasta shelves for more than 25 years.

        "description": " So much depends upon the length of a grain of rice. Though it may sound trivial, the textural difference just between long and medium grain rice is a whole other world, culinarily speaking. Whereas long-grained varietals like Jasmine and Basmati tend to have a drier, more individualized texture, like you’d find in a typical fried rice dish, medium-grained rice tends to be a little closer and stickier, like what you’d expect to find in risotto or paella. Trader Joe’s Calrose Rice is a classic example of the latter. Once cooked, it’s elegantly soft and fluffy, and holds onto flavors with ease — the perfect rice for poke or teriyaki bowls, and just the thing to round out our rice selection.

        "description": " One of our favorite things about truffle is just how wonderfully its savory flavors and intense aromas interact with other flavors and sensations, Take something like Burrata, for example. Already a superbly sumptuous eating experience in its own right, the silky-soft, fresh mozzarella exterior and sweet, delicately creamy interior of Burrata acts as a perfect foil to the earthy notes of black truffle, creating a uniquely delicious interplay of taste and texture — and one that you can savor in every bite of Trader Joe’s Truffle Buratta.

And it’s USDA Choice Angus Beef — the same quality grade you'll find in our Trader Joe’s Premium Angus Steak program. Generally speaking, this extraordinarily tender cut is best presented with a bit of a seasoning boost, the way filet mignon is often complemented by a rich sauce. Here, our Boneless Roast has been rubbed with a seasoning blend that includes Porcini mushrooms, salt, minced garlic, onion powder, red bell peppers, parsley flakes, and chili peppers.\n\nAll this prep (which we’ve happily done for you!) complements the Beef Loin’s tenderness with a deep, nutty flavor that makes putting this Roast on the table a special event, indeed. You need only pop it in a 375°F oven for about an hour, then let it rest about 10 minutes before slicing and serving.

Trader Joe’s Chocolate Passport takes you on a journey through the terroirs of the cacao-growing world — Peru, Ecuador, Venezuela, The Dominican Republic, Ghana, Papua New Guinea, Sao Tome, and Tanzania — delivering a collection of eight distinctive bars of chocolate with cacao solids ranging from 60% to 73%. Each bar conveys character, beyond just “chocolate,” typical for its region. Savor a bite and you may detect jasmine, dried grass, fresh fruit, wood, flowers, and vanilla.\n\nAs you’ve surely gathered, this is chocolate to be savored. Take a bite, let it linger, and then try another. In honor of the worldly nature of the chocolate’s origins, we’ve placed them in a handsome, highly-giftable passport-like package. Give one to a friend with unsatiated wanderlust, a coworker with a refined palate, or yourself, if you happen to be a fan of world-class chocolate.

        "description": " One of only twelve Swiss cheeses with an official Appellation d'Origine Protegèe (\"protected designation of origin\"), Tête de Moine is a cheese with an 800-year-old recipe. It’s crafted with part-skim cow’s milk, the fresh product of eight village creameries in the Swiss region of origin. Once made, the petite, cylindrical wheels of cheese are matured on spruce wood boards for at least two-and-a-half months. Now, here’s where it gets really interesting: Each wheel is centered on a steel post so it may rotate while a very sharp cutting tool is dragged along the surface of the cheese. The result is super-thin and long slices that naturally curl as they are cut, forming what resembles a delicate rose.

        "description": " Even without dressing it up, Alfredo Sauce is already rich, creamy, and cheesy — an undisputed icon of comfort food. So how could we possibly improve upon it? By adding Truffle, of course! (Honestly, it seems obvious, now that we’re saying it out loud.) With Trader Joe’s Black Truffle Alfredo Pasta Sauce, we’ve taken something full-bodied and flavorful and given it something of an epicurean upgrade.\n\nStarting with a classic, velvety Alfredo made with savory grated Pecorino Romano and Grana Padano, our supplier then adds real pieces of black summer truffle to complete this captivatingly comfy recipe — just enough to evoke the earthy, umami aspect of truffle without overpowering the sauce’s creaminess. We find that, in addition to making a mean (not to mention effortless) fettuccine Alfredo, it can also be used to give other comfort food classics an exciting, truffle-y twist: try using it in lieu of tomato sauce in your next pizza or lasagna, for instance.

        "description": " First created in the Dutch city of Gouda (that’s right, that Gouda) sometime near the turn of the 19th century, Stroopwafels (literally syrup waffles in Dutch) have since become a certified national treasure of the Netherlands, and are now a curiously caramel-y staple of the Trader Joe’s holiday lineup. They’re made by pressing waffles made from a dense, flavorful batter in a hot iron, then quickly slicing those waffles in half while they’re still hot, and sandwiching sweet, stretchy caramel in between each slice. The resulting cookie is a uniquely delicious experience, especially when enjoyed in the traditional Dutch way: place a Stroopwafel over a hot cup of coffee or tea, and let the steam gently soften the caramel inside to a perfect level of gooeyness.

They use real butter to make its elegantly moist base, to which they add plump, juicy raisins and candied fruit to give each delightfully sweet cake its distinctly festive flavor and texture. Equally delicious when enjoyed as a dessert or as a breakfast treat (Panettone French toast, anyone?), and especially amenable to serving with coffee, Trader Joe’s Panettone is a tradition you won’t want to miss.

Made for us in Southern Italy, our Baked Lemon Ricotta Cheese starts with fresh milk, salt, and whey. The resulting curd is blended with a sweet lemon paste — made with the likes of lemon peel, lemon extract, & sugar — then placed into circular molds and baked at low temperatures. When these wheels emerge from the oven and cool, they do in fact look like dessert. And you can serve it for dessert! (If you close your eyes and took a bite, you might think you’re biting into soft, sumptuous slice of lemon cheesecake…) The winning part of this proposition, though, is that you can also serve it on a cheese platter before dinner, and no one will look askance. Or here’s a fresh idea: mix it into a hot bowl of Fusilli (p. 5) for a creamy, lemony “sauce” that will leave your dinner guests pining for seconds.

It’s a miniscule amount of prep (place it on a foil or parchment-lined baking sheet, and bake!) with a mightily palate-pleasing payoff; if you want to fancy things up further, let it defrost a bit and top with & , a dollop of tart , or perhaps a sprinkle of before baking.

        "description": " We’re quite taken with Taralli. A traditional wintertime snack that dates all the way back to the 15th century, you could consider them to be the Southern Italian cousins to the mini-pretzel: they’re crunchy, bready, and splendidly savory, with a distinctive curlicue shape. Charming in their simplicity, they have a satisfying, breadstick-like texture, and mild, but habit-forming, flavor profile that’s accented by just a touch of olive oil and salt. And, like any true Italian treat, they make an excellent companion to wine — many Taralli enthusiasts like to dunk them directly in their vino before snacking, in fact. We’re so taken, in fact, that we took some organic Taralli, combined them with a number of similarly organic, crunchy, wine-friendly crackers, and placed them in our Organic Taralli and Friends assortment, just for the holidays.

        "description": " There’s some serious science behind the fermentation process that leaves fermented garlic as black, soft, and surprisingly sweet as it is. When subjected to just the right level of heat and humidity, the allicin within fresh garlic — i.e., the chemical that gives garlic its uniquely pungent flavor and aroma — begins to break down into S-allylcysteine, a compound that turns the whitish garlic cloves black, softens them, and converts their distinctly garlicky flavor into something sweeter, richer, and more complex. Intrigued? We can’t blame you. Luckily, with Trader Joe’s Ground Fermented Black Garlic, it’s never been easier to add this extraordinary flavor to whatever dish strikes your fancy.

        "description": "Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Bisque is the result of our Product Developer’s six-month-long search for the sublime in the soup section. Working hand in hand with our supplier, we tasted and re-tasted a number of iterations, and when we hit on this one, we unanimously chimed in with “Yes!” Unlike our previous Pumpkin Soup, this Bisque is thick and rich and creamy and exceptionally flavorful. It’s made with pumpkin purée, heavy cream, some honey for sweetness, and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg. The not-so-secret ingredient (it’s on the label after all) that pulls all the flavors together is tahini. The savory nuttiness of sesame gives the soup a depth that none of us were expecting, and that left every last one of us wanting more.

Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Bread and Muffin Mix has all these things, and the majority of the mixing and measuring is already done. The Mix – combined with eggs, oil, and water – makes a generous loaf of moist and fluffy, lightly spiced pumpkin bread, or a dozen standard-sized muffins. If you find yourself feeling adventurous, add chopped nuts; dried fruit like raisins, cranberries, or apples; or shredded carrots or zucchini for an extra splash of color and texture – or go all out and add all of these things to make a Fall Harvest Loaf unique to your kitchen. “Kids” we know really love it mixed with chocolate chips.

This creamy dessert is made with loads of rich, smooth cream cheese, impressive amounts of actual pumpkin (it’s no longer round by the time it’s blended here), and seasonal, pumpkin pie spices. It makes a quick and easy dessert for a special-occasion gathering (why not dress it up with spooky accoutrements for Halloween?), a weekend dinner party, or a weeknight supper with the family. Carve it up—you’re probably best sticking with slices, as jack o’lantern-style carving would leave some cheesecake lovers with significantly less to love than others—and top the slices with freshly whipped cream, ice cream, crème anglaise, caramel sauce, or nothing at all—the flavor of the Cheesecake is rewarding enough.

        "description": "Sfogliatelle [sfow-lee-ah-TELL-ee] is a popular puff-style pastry from the Campania region of southern Italy, surrounding Naples. Stacked layers, like very thin “leaves,” create a crisp, delicate texture that’s typically filled with some kind of sweet cream. On one visit to the region, we encountered Sfogliette [sfow-lee-EH-tee], a snack cracker with similar delicate attributes to its pastry relative, but with a savory profile. This led directly to the creation of Trader Joe’s Rosemary Sfogliette.

        "description": " If your guest list is short, or meat-eaters are in the minority, a whole, big bird might feel like the center-of-the-plate equivalent of hyperbole. In these situations, what you need is Trader Joe's Fully Cooked Brined Bone-In Half Turkey Breast to eliminate the excess, while still supplying several juicy, flavorful portions of meat for the interested parties at the party. Our Midwest supplier splits a full turkey breast, leaving the bone in, and marinating it in a brine of salt, sugar, black pepper, and garlic-herb butter. The Half Breast is then seared, and slowly cooked sous-vide. It's not an exaggeration to say this approach produces a moist, juicy, and tender Half Turkey Breast with rich, slow-roasted flavor-and in just 40 minutes, versus the multiple hours it takes to cook a whole turkey. Find our Fully Cooked Brined Bone-In Half Turkey Breasts (about 2.5 pounds each on average) in our refrigerated deli section.

They make an excellent accessory to charcuterie boards and cheese plates, where their mild flavor and homey notes of ghee work together to accentuate more savory flavors. We personally like them best when paired with a creamy, richly aromatic dip, like a garlicky hummus or a quick, homemade raita. Carry on, Organic Naan Crackers, and on, and on!

Perhaps it’s the way that every satisfying spoonful seems to warm you from the inside out. Perhaps it’s the fact that it’s used in so many iconic fall recipes, like a classic green bean casserole. Whatever the case, this silky, seasonal Soup is here to bring you the comforts of autumn.

After observing her pass on a pre-packaged bunch of bananas, he said, “Excuse me, ma’am, but why aren’t you buying those bananas?” With the confidence of a customer who’d been around the banana-block, she shared with him that it would make her life much easier if we sold bananas individually, rather than in pre-packaged bunches. At her age, she explained, she wanted to take life one banana at a time. Well, we listened, and that’s why Trader Joe’s sells bananas one banana at a time.

And so we proudly offer Trader Joe’s Breaded Turkey-less Stuffed Roast, a totally vegan, superbly savory, plant-based entreé that even comes with its own vegan gravy! Made mostly from wheat gluten, our vegan Roast is first stuffed with wild rice, cranberries, celery and onions. Then, our supplier coats it in a crisp, delicious breading seasoned with herbs and red pepper flakes, infusing each bite with terrifically tempting texture and taste. Simply heat it up, slice it into medallions, and serve with a side of steaming hot gravy, et voilà—a vegan holiday masterpiece is yours for the eating!

        "description": " We’ve looked over the numbers. We’ve run and re-run experiments and simulations. Every time, we come to the same conclusion: every meal, even a meal as big as Thanksgiving dinner, can be improved by adding cheesy potatoes. That’s why we’re such big fans of frozen side dishes like our new Scallopini Potatoes. They’re made for us by an Italian supplier, who slices the potatoes nice and thin, and then covers them, layer by layer, in a super creamy sauce made with a blend of four Italian cheeses. The result is everything you could ask for in a side dish: moist, easy-textured potatoes, rich, savory cream sauce, and gooey, delicious cheese. They’re also super easy to prepare: just 45 to 50 minutes at 350º in the oven (or 11 minutes in the microwave) are all that separates you and an officially cheesy-potato-fied meal. Whether you need an extra side for the holiday table, family feast, or even just a quick weekend dinner, Trader Joe’s Scallopini Potatoes are the logical choice—trust us, we’ve done the research.

Next, sauté the Brussels sprouts in a little olive oil over medium heat until warm and tender (about three minutes). Then, mix in the vinaigrette and continue to cook until temptingly fragrant (another two minutes or so), garnish with the Parmesan and hazelnuts, et voilà. You now have a side ready to roll.

Other times, you just want a sauce that brings a lot of spice, a lot of garlic, and a whole lot of flavor. Trader Joe's Indian Style Garlic Achaar Sauce definitely fits in the latter category. It's inspired by achaar (Hindi for \"pickle\"), a tradition of Indian cuisine that some estimate originated 4,000 years ago. Our version swaps out the whole cloves of a typical lahsun ka achaar dish with puréed roasted and fresh garlic, which combines with puréed red Anaheim and jalapeño peppers to create one super savory, satisfyingly spicy Sauce.

Our Crusts come a little larger than most other store-bought options out there, meaning you have a little more leeway for working with bigger tins — plus, you can trim the excess for use in decoration, if you’d like.

        "description": "Our Italian Linguine is made with one simple ingredient: durum wheat semolina. We don’t believe that a simple macaroni product that’s been produced for centuries should require a laundry list of added ingredients to achieve tasty results. And let’s get one thing clear: Trader Joe’s Italian Linguine is a tasty product. It can be served with just a little olive oil, but becomes especially tasty when traditionally plated with a simple pesto to coat each elliptical noodle as you spin a bit onto your fork. Other common taste-elavating options include using tomato-based sauces or a light sauce with a seafood addition - think salmon, cod, or shrimp. In as little as 7 to 8 minutes of passively boiling pasta, you can have yourself a plate of Italian Linguine noodles, toothsomely al dente, of course, and you’ll be sending your tastebuds on a flavorful flight 6,000 miles across the Atlantic to our favorite boot shaped nation!

Our supplier, who has been in the noodle game for more than a century now, begins with 100% durum semolina wheat that they mill into flour onsite. They craft exquisitely smooth Spaghetti using only two main ingredients, as dictated by tradition: semolina and water. This is pasta that pairs well with almost any sauce, but these days, we’re particularly fond of smothering it with marinara. Break out the good china and the fancy candlesticks!

While not wanting to take anything away from Croatian culture, we think it’s important to recognize that Farfalle, the pasta shape that looks like a bow tie, was invented in Northern Italy about a hundred years before anyone thought to tie a scarf into a bow around his neck. Sure, Farfalle translates to “butterflies,” and they do in fact look like little butterflies as well, but when was the last time you heard anyone refer to them as “butterfly pasta”?

It’s even sparked a friendly (if not, at times, heated) rivalry between a handful of nations regarding who makes the best version.

        "description": " For Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Spiced Teeny Tiny Pretzels, we’ve taken classic mini pretzels, in all its salty, crispy, crunchy glory and covered them in a sweet, pumpkin spice-infused yogurt coating. Then, we dot them with our very own Pumpkin Spiced Pumpkin Seeds and even more spices and sweets, like real bits of lemon peel to complete this symphony of salty, sweet, crunchy, pumpkin-spiced goodness. As you can see, with pretzels as our vehicle, we’re taking pumpkin-spiced snacks to the next level. The layers of crunchy pumpkin seeds, soft & chewy yogurt coating, and the actual pretzel within give each Teeny Tiny Pretzel a curiously gratifying texture, while the mix and salty and sweet keep you coming back for more!

They’re typically made from a simple recipe of sweet, yeasted batter, but require a highly specialized skillet called a poffertjespan to attain their perfectly snackable, one-or-two-bite size.

        "description": "Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Bisque is the result of our Product Developer’s six-month-long search for the sublime in the soup section. Working hand in hand with our supplier, we tasted and re-tasted a number of iterations, and when we hit on this one, we unanimously chimed in with “Yes!” Unlike our previous Pumpkin Soup, this Bisque is thick and rich and creamy and exceptionally flavorful. It’s made with pumpkin purée, heavy cream, some honey for sweetness, and spices including cinnamon and nutmeg. The not-so-secret ingredient (it’s on the label after all) that pulls all the flavors together is tahini. The savory nuttiness of sesame gives the soup a depth that none of us were expecting, and that left every last one of us wanting more.

        "description": "One of our favorite things about homemade pumpkin bread is the way the subtle flavor of the pumpkin is perfectly complemented by the lively flourishes of cinnamon and nutmeg. Trader Joe’s Pumpkin Bread and Muffin Mix has all these things, and the majority of the mixing and measuring is already done. The Mix – combined with eggs, oil, and water – makes a generous loaf of moist and fluffy, lightly spiced pumpkin bread, or a dozen standard-sized muffins. If you find yourself feeling adventurous, add chopped nuts; dried fruit like raisins, cranberries, or apples; or shredded carrots or zucchini for an extra splash of color and texture – or go all out and add all of these things to make a Fall Harvest Loaf unique to your kitchen. “Kids” we know really love it mixed with chocolate chips.

This creamy dessert is made with loads of rich, smooth cream cheese, impressive amounts of actual pumpkin (it’s no longer round by the time it’s blended here), and seasonal, pumpkin pie spices. It makes a quick and easy dessert for a special-occasion gathering (why not dress it up with spooky accoutrements for Halloween?), a weekend dinner party, or a weeknight supper with the family. Carve it up—you’re probably best sticking with slices, as jack o’lantern-style carving would leave some cheesecake lovers with significantly less to love than others—and top the slices with freshly whipped cream, ice cream, crème anglaise, caramel sauce, or nothing at all—the flavor of the Cheesecake is rewarding enough.

Stacked layers, like very thin “leaves,” create a crisp, delicate texture that’s typically filled with some kind of sweet cream. On one visit to the region, we encountered Sfogliette [sfow-lee-EH-tee], a snack cracker with similar delicate attributes to its pastry relative, but with a savory profile. This led directly to the creation of Trader Joe’s Rosemary Sfogliette.

Not falling very far from the tree, the Honeycrisp Apple has inherited the sweetness and crispness of its parents, each bite popping with an explosive crunch, giving way to very sweet, slightly tart flesh, which is also quite excellent for pie-making. And here is a fun fact: Honeycrisps contain larger cell structures than other apples, which is how it gets its crispy bite.

        "description": "Famed for their importance in Caribbean cuisine, and named for their physical resemblance to a woolen tam o’ shanter cap, Scotch bonnet chilis have a delicate sweetness to them and a remarkable level of heat – a few orders of magnitude hotter than jalapeños, for reference. And as the makers of Trader Joe’s Cheddar with Scotch Bonnet Chilis and Red Peppers have found, these qualities make them a natural companion to the inherent nuttiness and crumbly texture of a classic English Cheddar. Using a mix of time-tested cheesemaking techniques and state of the art equipment, they flavor this savory Cheddar with sweet and fiery Scotch bonnet chili relish to great acclaim in supermarkets across the U.K. – and we’re proud to say that we’re the first to carry it across the pond.

        "description": "Nothing subliminal about it; these ice cream sandwiches more than live up to their name. Trader Joe’s Sublime Ice Cream Sandwiches came to fruition some years back, when we had an ice cream epiphany and realized we could do better—way better—than most of the ice cream sandwiches we found in freezers around the country. Not to insinuate that it was easy. Not at all. It took months and months of tasting and re-tasting by our panel. (Yes, it’s a messy job, but someone had to do it!) When the chocolate chip cookies finally reached the proper crunchy-chewy ratio (which changed, by the way, depending on how long they’d been frozen), we moved on to the ice cream; it had to be truly transcendent. After a few go-rounds, we landed on the ideal balance of cookie and ice cream. Then, of course, we had to make them even better, so we rolled the sides in mini, semi-sweet chocolate chips. In case you were curious, this is the kind of task we can always be counted on to undertake with vigilance.

        "description": "The secret to Trader Joe’s Mandarin Orange Chicken’s success is in its simplicity, really. Tender chunks of juicy chicken in a crispy breading with a sweet and spicy orange sauce… what’s not to love? And here’s our favorite way to prepare it: bake the chicken in a 400º oven; when the chicken is cooked through, add the sauce to a skillet or wok; once the sauce is hot, add the chicken and toss together until the sauce adheres to the chicken and caramelizes a bit. You can also microwave the sauce and toss it with the chicken, but we think the little bit of extra effort pays off handsomely. Serve with rice and veggies for a complete meal that doesn’t take much time to prepare, and delivers big flavors at a small price.

Judging from the number of bags that fly through our stores (figurative flying; the bags are not meant to be airborne), the love is near-universal. Made for us in Pennsylvania (properly prodigious pretzel pedigree), each real-peanut-butter-filled pretzel nugget is coated with coarse salt, and delivers crunchy and creamy and salty. They’re great party nibbles with cocktails or beer, juice or even sparkling water, and they make satisfying snacks for lunchboxes or after-school.

It’s crafted for us on an established estate, idyllically situated between the rolling Dorset Downs and the Jurassic Coast—an international world heritage site, lush with pastures. With more than 40 years of traditional cheese making experience, a famed farm on this estate transforms rich, creamy milk from local grazing herds (within a 30 mile radius) into beautiful, full-bodied farmhouse Cheddar. Inspired by a classically British ploughman’s lunch pairing (cheese & chutney), these blending artists mix caramelized onion marmalade into the Cheddar, giving it a balanced sweet-savory bite and pleasing onion aroma. It’s firm, creamy and adorned throughout with bits of onion. It’s memorable!

The semolina, smile-shaped pasta is bathed in an ooey-gooey- and-oh-so-creamy sauce that showcases a generous amount of four shredded cheeses – Cheddar, Havarti, Gouda, and Swiss. Smoothed with milk and butter, the cheeses melt to blanket the elbows beautifully – though, a quick stir can seriously spread the gooey-d-ness. Whether you heat in the microwave (about 5 minutes) or bake it in the oven (about 25 minutes), our Mac ‘n Cheese easily becomes the kind of cozy dish that leaves you feeling satisfied and happy.

We wanted to pay proper tribute to this sublimely simple, time-tested dish, so we went back to its ancestral roots to work with an Italian supplier who specializes in traditional recipes. Doing just as the Romans did, Trader Joe’s Cacio E Pepe Pasta Sauce combines Pecorino Romano cheese, made from sheep’s milk, with bold, black pepper to create a cheesy, savory sauce that’s deceptively simple, and simply delicious.

        "description": "Made from a base of highly refined coconut oil, our Parmesan Shreds are packed with all the same salty, nutty, and supremely savory notes of traditional, dairy-based Parmesan—but contain only plant-based ingredients. These Shreds are a great option for sprucing up soups, salads, pasta, potatoes, and everything in between. Since they were designed with vegans non-vegans in mind, Plant-Based Parmesan Shreds can be used in both vegan and non-vegan dishes with equal aplomb. We must admit, though, that they do present some especially delicious opportunities for vegan recipes: imagine roasted Brussels sprouts sprinkled with melty, savory, vegan Parmesan, or a luxuriously creamy salad tossed with our also-vegan Spicy Cashew Dressing and topped with these Shreds for some extra texture.

We reached out to one of our suppliers to develop this treat just for us, and the result is a warm-weather novelty you’ll only find in our stores. It’s a simple formulation: sweet ube ice cream (known for its vanilla-meets-pistachio flavor), enveloped in a rice-flour-based, purple-hued (from fruit and vegetable juice), mochi wrapper. The chewy exterior leads you to the sweet, creamy center. As the kids say, it’s all good. It really is. Each piece is a mere 80 calories, though we’ve not yet figured out how to eat just one.

This fresh, crisp base is triple-washed and ready to be tossed with our organic dressing (included and packaged separately). It’s a classic slaw dressing that’s creamy and slightly sweet—made with organic expeller pressed soybean oil and organic cider vinegar. Organic egg yolks contribute creaminess, while garlic, dehydrated onion, sea salt and black pepper bring a savory factor. Some organic cane sugar and organic lemon juice add just the right amount of sweet/tangy balance.

Known by many as “the caviar of the South,” this highly craveable concoction of shredded Cheddar, zesty, diced pimento, and a binding agent (in most cases, mayonnaise) tops everything from crackers to sandwiches to endive leaves across the southern United States – and its national popularity has only grown in recent years. In order to keep up with the spreading excitement for this exciting spread, we’ve intoduced Trader Joe’s Pimento Cheese Dip, our own take on this Southern classic, that ups the creaminess factor via the introduction of a lush, luxurious, Neufchâtel-like cream cheese to the mix.

Small – four-to-six inches in length – sweet and seedless, these cukes feature skins that are so thin and delicate that they have the same great flavor and texture with or without the skins. The upside to that? No peeling required. Ever. Win!

After trying a few variations, we found that a plant-based, dairy-free cream cheese provided the best base, and after mixing in just the right amount of lemon juice and chopped up cucumber, fresh dill, and garlic, we knew we had it: Trader Joe’s Vegan Tzatziki Dip was born.

The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures – their diet of natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that’s rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. Raising cattle organically, on grass, is a significantly more expensive endeavor than raising them via conventional methods. (If you’ve ever wondered why organic, grass-fed meat is more costly than conventional beef, this is why – it requires more space, more time, and more labor.)

        "description": "Here’s a little fruit to sweeten what remains of summer: Mini Sweet Peppers. Yes, peppers are considered fruit.  These colorful gems, grown on North American farms, measure about 2.5 inches long and look like miniature bell peppers. They taste like them, too—but even sweeter and crunchier. This means they are ideal for adding to salads.

        "description": "In the past, we’ve sold that famous, name-brand nut-butter and cocoa spread (you know the one), and even created a private-label version to sell, at one point. Frankly, our customers weren’t as excited about either version. We think the main problem is hazelnuts. No offense to hazelnuts, but they taste too much like… hazelnuts. Knowing that there was likely a better nut-butter and cocoa combination to be had, we went to work tasting: peanut butter with chocolate; chocolate with cashew butter… It wasn’t until we got to almonds that we realized we had the makings of a winner! Trader Joe’s Cocoa Almond Spread is made with a creamy nut-butter made from California almonds. We blend this familiar and favored nut flavor with Belgian cocoa to create a creamy, chocolately, almondy spread. As you might have guessed, this version has been a supreme success since its debut in 2011. Whether you put it on pancakes, scoop it with apple slices, or spread it on a sandwich, we believe you’ll agree our Cocoa Almond Spread is a tried-and-true taste sensation!

Combined, these ingredients create an impeccably textured Salsa with plenty of savory spices and tempered heat — a Salsa that pays homage to its culinary tradition and goes well on just about anything — a Salsa that’s, simply put, simply Autentica.

Well, okay, maybe not always... Our Smoked Andouille Chicken Sausage is made with coarsely chopped skinless chicken breast meat, seasoned with flavorful additions like crushed red pepper, black pepper, Cayenne pepper and garlic, then stuffed into natural (pork) casings and smoked just long enough to achieve a delicious balance between smoky and spicy. Like all our sausages, these have no added preservatives, no artificial ingredients, and no MSG. What they do have are big, bold, fresh flavors, the convenience of being fully cooked, and the versatility to fit so many eating occasions, from a bowl of Jambalaya to a backyard barbecue; hot dogs, watch out!

        "description": "The formula for Organic Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce is simple: Sriracha + BBQ Sauce… but, the genius is in the details. We start with Sriracha (not the famous “Rooster” version, but our very own recipe). This spicy mixture of chili peppers, garlic, sugar, and vinegar is deftly combined with what some might label as “Memphis-style” BBQ Sauce—referring to its tomato-base, thick texture, reddish-brown color, and the taste of sweet molasses. As if this duo were not already dynamic enough, we decided to go all out Organic. Each and every ingredient in our Sriracha & Roasted Garlic BBQ Sauce was produced using methods that preserve the environment and avoid synthetic materials, such as pesticides and antibiotics.

        "description": " Thinking about pancakes or waffles? Maybe a batch of fudgy vegan gluten free brownies? How about some home-made tortillas? We suggest Trader Joe’s Cassava Cauliflower Blend Baking Mix. This mix is a carefully calibrated blend of three gluten free flours – cassava, cauliflower, and fonio – combined with baking powder & salt, making it ready to use for so many cooking and baking endeavors. Our supplier, originally from Nigeria, is passionate about bringing the foods she grew up with in West Africa to the American palate. Here, she’s combined Cassava – also known as yuca – a starchy, root vegetable that behaves much like wheat flour in baking, with Fonio, a nutrient-dense grain related to millet, and native to West Africa. When milled into flour, it delivers a mild, subtly nutty flavor. Including cauliflower powder (flour) in the blend means lower overall carbs than comparable gluten free baking mixes. This multi-purpose baking mix is mild-tasting, and produces baked goods that are dense and delicious – not grainy or gritty like some other gluten free mixes.

Popcorn kernels are popped in a blend of coconut and sunflower oils, and then, true to their kettle corn roots, they’re lightly coated with sugar and salt. Along the way, they’re treated to both lime and Key Lime flavors, adding a layer of vibrancy we’ve never before tasted in a Kettle Popcorn. Every crunchy bite is sweet, salty, tart, and tangy. Think of it as a gluten free, kosher (pareve) trip to the tropics in every bag. Or, at the very least, a journey away from ordinary snacking.

There are a few theories as to why: some argue that it's a tendency for higher gluten content, some point to a mastery of fermentation techniques, others tie it to various intangible qualities of local ingredients. Whatever the cause, it's all academic unless you have the chance to visit France. But that got us thinking: why not bring France to our freezers? Thus, we bring to you Trader Joe's Mini French Baguettes, a collection of six compact, individual baguettes, made especially for us by a French bakery, which are baked to about 80% doneness, then frozen for you to finish at home. And that means one thing in particular: ineffably French, perfectly baked Baguettes, fresh from your very own oven.

But when you can get them together, as the talented hands behind Mobay® Cheese have done, that’s something else entirely. Crafted for us by the certified Master Cheesemakers at a renowned Wisconsin creamery, our latest Spotlight Cheese is made by stacking together wheels of flavorful goat’s milk cheese and sheep’s milk cheese, with just a thin layer of faintly smoky grapevine ash in between them.

For thousands of years, you’ve inspired such passion, from ancient Mesopotamia to modern America. You’ve also inspired Trader Joe’s Italian Truffle Cheese, which is definitely dear because it is good. Our Italian Truffle Cheese is made with black truffles from central Italy’s Umbria region. Made from pasteurized cow’s milk, it’s a young cheese, aged for 15 days. Its mild flavor makes it the ideal canvas for the concentrated truffle oil and black truffle pieces that are blended liberally throughout the cheese. The truffles’ earthy, woody, musky aroma shines, and on the palate, it delivers with aplomb. The semi-soft nature makes this an excellent melting cheese – it’s delicious melted over roasted meats, makes delightful omelets, and adds dynamic dimension to pasta or potato dishes. It also makes a bold statement on a cheese board.

Taking flavorful cues from equal parts tang and density from sour cream and the sweetness of whipped cream and marrying them together with a classic brie base, Saint André Triple Crème Brie is a cheese for the unyielding connoisseur. Gourmands unite! This Saint André Triple Crème Brie has a bloomy, edible rind surrounding a lusciously smooth, creamy paste made from cow’s milk and enriched with pure cream. This cheese has no less than 75% butterfat making every bite full of dreamy creamy delight.

They then place that in a pouch that can be boiled, in-bag, for five minutes, or microwaved for one minute, and served in an instant.

In addition to the dreamy, sweet cream ice cream base, our Georgia-based supplier also makes the inclusions in-house – specifically, swirls of luscious peach jam (made with South Carolina-grown peaches, of course) and chunks of buttery oat crisp imbued with hints of cinnamon & sugar. It captures the nostalgic notes of a fresh, Southern peach crisp in a single pint of ice cream, with plenty of creamy-meets-crunchy, craveable contrast.

And so, we did! Our new Trader Joe’s BBQ Pulled Chicken is made with a combination of breast and thigh meat that’s been tumbled in a tangy, tomato-based marinade that’s rounded out with molasses and vinegar, along with a host of savory spices and notes of hickory smoke. The marinated chicken is then oven-roasted and pulled, doused in more of the sweet & smoky BBQ sauce and cooked sous vide, resulting in unbelievably juicy, flavorful meat that’s ready to pile high on a bun, a bed of Lemony Arugula Basil Salad, or a stack of tortilla chips. A quick spin in the microwave and you can enjoy the best of slow-smoked BBQ goodness, no grill necessary.

What might surprise you is that even a fruity flavor as unique as watermelon pairs exceptionally well with chocolate, too—as Trader Joe’s Dark Chocolate Watermelon Sticks ably demonstrate. They’re made for us by the same supplier as their aforementioned Orange-flavored counterparts, a family-owned candy business that’s been making sweets for over a century. Each eminently snackable Stick is made with a soft, silky, delightfully chewy watermelon-flavored center that’s coated in a rich, sturdy, delicious dark chocolate shell. They’re firm enough to hold their shape, but melt beautifully in your mouth, with a vibrant, lush flavor that keeps you coming back for Stick after Stick after Stick.

And so it goes for Key Lime Pie, a treasure of the Florida Keys. We know for certain it originated in Key West in the 1850’s, and we know the key to the magic was (and is) canned sweetened condensed milk, which allowed cooks without easy access to refrigeration to quickly and easily make treats like ice cream or custard. Beyond that, the history gets murky, and really depends on whose story you choose to believe.

Separately, each chip is an exquisitely evocative simulacrum of hearty backyard cuisine. Together, they’re a symphony greater than the sum of their summery parts: the sweetness of the Homestyle Ketchup plays off the delightfully sour edge of the Sea Salt & Vinegar, while the classic Smokin’ Sweet BBQ harmonizes perfectly with the savory and aromatic Delicious Dill. All told, all four chip varieties together conjure the taste of a glorious barbecued hamburger. Not bad for a handful of potato chips, eh?

        "description": "Dining alfresco is a fundamental summer activity, one we take seriously here at Trader Joe’s. We’ve got seasonal sauces, thirst-quenching coolers, and delectable desserts on offer that are ideal for outdoor indulgence – desserts like Trader Joe’s Citrus Mousse Cakes. Each two-or-three-bite-sized piece features a thick layer of moist, vanilla cake topped by an even thicker layer of luscious, orange- or lemon-flavored mousse, and finally enrobed in sweet, orange or yellow confectionary coating (hues courtesy of turmeric and paprika, rather than artificial dyes), and finally hand-decorated with a little green stem to look just like an orange, or a lemon. The end result creates a charming fruit basket effect on a serving plate, while their nostalgic, citrus & vanilla flavor is not unlike that sweet summer classic, the 50/50 bar.

Together, along with a supportive mix of Cheddar, Parmesan, and bread crumbs, these ingredients combine to create one delightfully flavorful filling that’s then packed into pockets of yellow-striped semolina pasta to create Trader Joe’s Sweet Corn, Burrata, & Basil Ravioli. Once cooked, each Ravioli is tender and cheesy, with a satisfying al dente texture that’s smartly accentuated by the pop of the whole, sweet corn kernels.

The cattle are 100% grass fed, grazing on wide-open pastures – their diet of natural grasses and vegetation contributes to full-flavored, well-marbled beef that’s rich in Omega-3 fatty acids. Raising cattle organically, on grass, is a significantly more expensive endeavor than raising them via conventional methods. (If you’ve ever wondered why organic, grass-fed meat is more costly than conventional beef, this is why – it requires more space, more time, and more labor.)

Instead, here you’ll find a 60/40 mix of whole, meaty almonds and crunchy cashews, coated in a seasoning blend that echoes the seedy seasoning that continues to be a sensation in our spice section. Black and white sesame seeds, poppy seeds, and sea salt combine with the pungent flavors of garlic and onion to complement these nuts. And complement is what it does, rather than overwhelm. You still get the robust flavor of both the almonds and cashews, along with the signature savory of the seasoning, along with six grams of protein per quarter-cup serving.

        "description": "We tend to think of cow’s milk as simply “milk,” but there’s actually quite a few intermediary steps between milk being produced by a cow and it reaching your cereal bowl. In the U.S., it’s typically pasteurized, for food safety, and homogenized, to make sure the cream doesn’t separate in the carton. In recent years, the process of ultra-filtration has grown in popularity, too. Ultra-filtered milk is created by filtering the milk with a membrane so fine that it actually removes the lactose, as well as some of the sugars that naturally occur in milk. It also creates a milk that’s considerably higher in protein and calcium than normal, and even tastes a little creamier. Sounds amazing, right? We thought so too, which is why we decided to bring Trader Joe’s Ultra-Filtered Chocolate Milk to our refrigerators.

Standing out from the crowd with regard to both size and shape are Trader Joe’s Salted Tortilla Chips, a sizeable, two-pound bag of stone-ground, white corn tortilla chips. Pleasantly salty and delightfully crispy with plenty of toasty corn flavor, these structurally sound rounds are ideal for crafting a plate of fully-loaded nachos, scooping Organic Salsa & formidably chunky guac, or crunching into chilaquiles for weekend brunch. Kosher-certified and gluten free, it’s their undeniable value that makes them a true force to be reckoned with in the snack aisle.

        "description": "Known as Orata in Italy, Dorada in Spain, and Gilthead Sea Bream in English-speaking countries, Trader Joe's Mediterranean Dorade (the French name) is farmed off the shores of North Africa. Dorade's mild-flavored, white meat is tender and tasty, which is why you'll find it on menus at fine restaurants around the world. It's regularly cooked in classics such as French Bouillabaisse (indeed, it also holds up well when simmered over a period of time). However, we've chosen to feature it in another classic form: the convenient and always at-hand fish tin!

        "description": "You may not be a meat eater, but that doesn't mean you can't enjoy the spiciness of authentic chorizo sausage. Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo is our vegetarian-friendly version of this traditionally Spanish sausage. It's made just for us by a small company that specializes in chorizo - they really do spend all their time focusing on chorizo, and we're pretty sure that's why this meat-free version is so authentically flavored. The authenticity comes from the spices - the same spices that have made traditional pork chorizo so famous. We toss in a blend of paprika, sea salt, vinegar, red pepper, and garlic powder to hit you with just the right amount of bold flavors. Trader Joe's Soy Chorizo has all of these tasty seasonings, but also with the healthy attributes come from the soy protein. Our Soy Chorizo has no cholesterol and 60% less fat than traditional chorizo. Add it to scrambled eggs and make a quick breakfast burrito. Or saut¿ it with oven roasted potato wedges for an intriguing brunch time side dish that will have your guests raving.

        "description": "With the popularity of sugar alternatives on the rise, honey—already a classic pantry staple—is having an extra-sweet moment in the spotlight. We currently offer some fantastic honeys in our grocery aisle, but we haven't offered a creamed honey on our shelves in quite some time. So, when our Buyer stumbled upon an opportunity to do so, she pounced—or stung, as it were...Trader Joe's Creamed Multi-Floral New Zealand Honey comes from bees pollinating a variety of different flowering trees, shrubs, plants, and other nectar sources. As a result, its flavor profile is a little bit floral, a little bit herbal, and a little bit earthy—kind of like Manuka honey, but less medicinal-tasting. About 80% of New Zealand's trees and plants are endemic to New Zealand, so when we say you won't find honey like this anywhere else, we mean it!

As they feed on the lush, green grasses of the countryside, they produce milk that tends to be richer and fuller in fat than their grain fed counterparts. Our supplier then takes this milk, adds a bit of salt (and, notably, nothing else), then uses traditional churning methods to create a profoundly creamy and delicious butter.

There's a distinct dynamism to it, where the more you crank up the sweetness and the spiciness, the more interesting the flavor profile becomes. In the case of Trader Joe's Chile Spiced Pineapple, for example, we've taken something super sweet and succulent (dried rings of pineapple from Ghana) and paired it up with something truly spicy (a bold chili powder blend with cayenne and traditional chamoy powder), plus a little extra cane sugar and salt to make a snack that hits that special mix of sweet and heat that leaves you craving more with every bite.

        "description": "Though we might think of it as a rather timeless classic, bolognese pasta sauce is a relatively recent invention. First described in print in the late 1800s, ragù alla bolognese started as a descendent of French ragoût, a hearty, meat-based stew. Since then, there’s never really been one definitive recipe for a bolognese sauce — many iterations don’t even include tomatoes — other than a commonality of braised beef, veal, or pork as the center of the dish. In other words, out of reach for non-carnivores. Until today, that is: Trader Joe’s Vegan Bolognese Style Pasta Sauce evokes all the savory splendor of a perfectly seasoned bolognese, but does so with tender crumbles made of pea protein, resulting in a sauce with as much protein as its meat-based cousins.

This relishlike sauce is typically made from a mix of ingredients including fresh chilis, garlic, shallots, and lime juice, all pounded together in a mortar. Our version adds some additional aromatic elements in the form of lemon grass and Thai lime leaves to create a delightfully complex condiment which doubles as a zesty, delicious dip.

And they’re fully cooked, so all you have to do is reheat & eat! Air fryer is the quickest method, yielding the crispest exterior, but our Potato Pancakes are equally yummy prepared in a skillet on the stovetop, or in a conventional oven. (See package for directions.) While latkes are a Hanukkah tradition, they're not just for holidays. We enjoy our kosher-certified Potato Pancakes at breakfast, dinner or anytime in between. Give them a try as a side with your favorite delicatessen delicacy, or as the foundation for a fantastic smoked salmon Benedict. Go old school and top them with sour cream and apple sauce, or feel free to think outside the box and melt a bit of shredded cheese over them as they fry.

They're brought to us by a trusted Italian supplier who has a particular knack for scrumptious stuffed pasta, and you can see their dedication to the craft in each delicately bundled Fiocchetto. More importantly, you can taste their dedication to tradition with every saucy, savory, exquisitely zesty bite.

Of course, one doesn't always have quick access to a noodle shop, nor the time to prepare pho from scratch, which is why we're introducing Trader Joe's Beef Pho Soup, a traditionally-inspired, sensationally-seasoned, heat-and-serve way to get your pho fix in a matter of minutes.

        "description": " Zhoug (pronounced ZOOg) likely originated in Yemen, and is now popular throughout the Middle East. It’s a cilantro-based sauce/condiment that’s been likened to “Middle Eastern pesto,” but we think that description shortchanges the originality of this spicy, fragrant, fabulously flavorful culinary creation. It’s a sauce that’s taking the internet by storm – from food blogs to social media feeds, Zhoug is having its moment in the digital sun. This really is the ideal time to introduce Zhoug to our stores.

Flavor-wise, coconut does not come to mind: Organic Coconut Aminos can be likened to soy sauce, though not quite as salty, and with a touch of sweetness. There are no soy ingredients in this product, and at 200mg of sodium per tablespoon (vs. 920mg in the leading soy sauce brand), this gluten-free, kosher (pareve) Sauce is a great option for those looking to reduce their sodium intake.

It's savory, tangy, and spicy-but not so spicy that you'd have any qualms about dousing your food in it-and there's no added sugar, to boot!

        "description": "Throughout Mexico and in cities across the U.S., street vendors sell mouthwatering, well-seasoned corn on the cob known as Elote. While the fixins may vary some from vendor to vendor, elote typically comes slathered in mayo or crema, rolled in grated Parmesan or cotija cheese, dusted with chili powder, and squirted with lime juice. As anyone who grew up visiting the neighborhood elotero or making elote at home can tell you, it's a highly crave-able combination of flavors that leaves a lifelong impression.

On its own, this would be a super hearty, profoundly delicious treat, but the addition of the mojo (a catchall in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine to describe sauces made from peppers, olive oil, and citrus juice) sauce totally kicks it into another gear, with pronounced notes of garlic, ginger, and orange zest. ¡Que rica!

        "description": "Almond butter has come a long way in recent years—what once was largely considered a second-fiddle offering to peanut butter's main event has come into its own. Our almond butter offerings run the gamut from creamy to crunchy, salted to unsalted, but one thing conspicuously missing from that list was an organic option for our almond butter aficionados. Until today, that is! Please welcome to our grocery shelves Trader Joe's Organic Creamy Unsalted Almond Butter: semi-savory, semi-sweet nut butter packed with all-almond flavor and made with organic almonds.

        "description": " Trader Joe's Twisted Cookies Sticks Dipped in Belgian Dark Chocolate are a wonder. It's not so much a question of how they are made. That's pretty straightforward-wheat-flour sticks, baked then dipped in dark chocolate. The wonder comes in the way the semi-sweetness of the smooth, rich, dark chocolate (not accidentally from Belgium) contrasts with the crisp crunch of the Cookie and its muted saltiness. It's sort of like a chocolate dipped pretzel, yet subtler. And, more cookie-like. Wonderful!

And though plantains are technically a fruit, they're commonly eaten like root vegetables. When you think of them this way, Trader Joe's Plantain Chips make perfect sense.

Trimmed into triangles, the dough is then fried in avocado oil to an airy crisp. It's plenty of flavor for straight snacking-but not too much to overwhelm your salsa & guac!

If you want phenomenal chocolate milk, though, you need to go all out. And all out we went with Trader Joe's Chocolate Milk made with Fair Trade Cocoa. We did not source this Chocolate Milk from chocolate cows. (If only they existed...) Instead, we started by sourcing fair trade cocoa from small family farms in Northern Peru. This cocoa is then mixed with Grade A homogenized whole milk and cane sugar. The resulting concoction is what you'll find in the charming cartons of kosher-certified Chocolate Milk. It's truly the most rich, creamy, dreamy Chocolate Milk we could find. In a glass with a straw. Blended with Trader Joe's ice cream into a milkshake. With Crispy Crunchy Chocolate Chip Cookies for dessert before bed. Don't ask us to pick a favorite way to enjoy this Chocolate Milk—they're all the best. Someday, there might be chocolate cows that produce the most delicious, rich chocolate milk. Until that day comes, you can enjoy Trader Joe's Chocolate Milk made with Fair Trade Cocoa.

That's why, when the time came to find a medium for a crouton that was delightfully crunchy, but still decidedly gluten free, we knew that one fruit would stand head and shoulders above the rest of the bunch. Now, Trader Joe's Plantain Croutons are here to provide some resounding crunch, along with gratifyingly garlicky seasoning, to salads, soups, and anything else that might benefit from a bit of extra flavor and texture.

Inspired by the same original soup dumplings, xiao long bao, that originated in the Jiangsu province of China, this type of dumpling is traditionally prepared in a xiaolong, the small bamboo steaming basket from which it gets its name. In English-speaking countries they're most often called Soup Dumplings because they are filled with hot soup (and therefore must be eaten carefully!) Xiao long bao are traditionally filled with pork, so this second entry in our freezers adheres closer to culinary tradition.
